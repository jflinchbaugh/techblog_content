<p>Just great!  I get my topic code in place, and I'm ready to move on to building an RSS feed.  But to whom will I feed it?  <a href = "http://www.javablogs.com/">java.blogs</a> seems to be dead.  Not just failing to respond, but the DNS doesn't exist for it anymore.  Oh well, maybe it's just an administrative glitch and they'll be back.  <a href = "http://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> isn't know for 100% reliability when it comes to their servers.</p>
