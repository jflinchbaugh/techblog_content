<p>This story about <a href = "http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=52">Poor Ranko</a>, the phone guy, and his likeness to a maintenance programmer is excellently recounted.  It's a lesson many of us have learned (or should have learned?) about coding shortcuts or having to deal with others' shortcuts.</p>
<p><a href = "http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/home">HackNot</a> will definitely be going into my blog roll to be watched in the future.  I'd also be interested in digging around to see what code he's using or if he indeed wrote his own, as I am.  It's a pretty clean site.</p>
