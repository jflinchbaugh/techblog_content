Groovy is relatively intuitive for me:
I can usually guess
a method or operator
and find it works
as I had guessed.

Removing a key/value by the key
from a Map conveniently
eludes me though.
I always guess that I should be able
to _minus_ a key from a Map
to produce a new Map
with that entry /value removed.
That doesn't work,
so I needed to invent my own.
I still not sure how to _practically_
apply it everywhere though,
or if it's even worthwhile.

@Category(Map)
class MapMinus {
    Map minus(Collection keys) {
        this.findAll { k, v -> ! (k in keys) }
    }
    Map minus(Object key) {
        this - [key]
    }
}

use (MapMinus) {
    assert [b: 2, c: 3,] == [a: 1, b: 2, c: 3,] - 'a'
    assert [b: 2, c: 3,] == [a: 1, b: 2, c: 3,] - ['a']

}
