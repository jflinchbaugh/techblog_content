I have https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim[MacVim] installed
by https://brew.sh/[Homebrew],
but MacVim still pops up sometimes to suggest an update,
and `brew` updates it as well.
After a year or 2 of this,
my "Open with..." menu
was littered with about 7 different versions
of MacVim dating back to version 7.4.

I figured I'd try to uninstall it,
`brew uninstall macvim`,
and see how many version I'm left.
The simple uninstall
confirmed that quite a few versions
of MacVim were installed,
and suggested the `--force` option
to remove them all, so I did.
That left `mvim` no longer working in the shell,
and fortunately,
*all* the MacVims had disappeared
from the "Open with..." menu as well.

Reinstalling it with `brew install macvim`
leaves me nicely with only one MacVim now.
I'll have to see if they multiply again,
but now I'll have this note to myself
on how to fix it.
