Since the beginning when I rebuilt
my blog with JBake,
I intended to split and restyle
the photography work from the tech work.

The photo work just disappeared from here,
so now it can be found at
http://blog.johnflinchbaugh.com/[John Flinchbaugh Photography].

Both sites are rebuilt
whenever new content is pushed
to their respective git repositories.
