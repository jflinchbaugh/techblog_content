~~~~~~
Once again,
I've taken the time
to review
my photos from the past year
to choose what I feel
are my 10 best.
I collected 205 candidates
over a couple days
and winnowed it down
to 10 in about 30 minutes.
(With that sort of momentum,
I'm lucky I had any photos left to show!)

It's been a year
of photographing people.
While toys, macros, and nature
may have gone _into_ the process,
those images didn't compete
with the all the interesting people.
My photographic lighting style
also continue to show up
in more images than not.

== Curiouser and Curiouser

The model shoots and events were good this year.
This is Masha Modelle at an event
at Omni Lens Studio.

== So Easily Swept Away

This image of Tara Doratt was shot upside down
at the Lancaster Camera Club Model Shoot
at Binns Park in Lancaster.


== Erica's Reflection

Sally invited me to participate
in a shoot among friends
who met at last year's Promoting Passion Conference,
so here I met Erica Jay,
and she came up with these lovely poses
and I came up with the lighting.
The pond is at Frog Hollow Studios.

== Follow Me Down

Here's another with Erica Jay.
She flopped herself down in that
contorted position,
and I just framed it up with the lines.
My speedlights were taking a little break,
so this is open, natural light.

== Becca Glow

This collaboration came about with Becca H
and DJ Diesel while we were
doing some promo shots.
I always like to toss a strobe
out in the front lawn
to get those crazy beams
through the blinds.

== The Way Back
image::{site_host}images/2016/way_back.jpg[role="narrower"]
Tourist Inn in Hellam
hosted a Braptizm party
and I fortunately found some hoopers.
With lots of shooting,
I managed this tight little frame
with so much motion.
I find it interesting
to find one of these frames
that work so well in black and white.
The star is a little bonus.

== Fireball

Aaron Brown provided me
this other black and white shot
spinning LED poi
at a Merr Bass at The Depot
in York, PA.


== Industrial Transport

DJ Kiltboy takes the helm
at Shadowland Lancaster.
As is often the case,
my little pop of flash freezes
Eric Carter in a swirling sea
of lights provided by DJ Diesel
at Lizard Lounge, Lancaster, PA.

== Spill Not a Drop
image::{site_host}images/2016/spill_not_a_drop.jpg[role="narrower"]
Cheers is a whirlwind
of a party thrown monthly
at JB Lovedraft
by the Skullfunkaz
in Harrisburg.
There's little room
to get out of the fray,
which is OK,
since I seldom stray far
from the dance floor,
especially when
they're spinning Drum n Bass all night.

== Rosie the Riveter

Marie had a great Halloween costume,
and it deserved to be captured
in one of my favorite images
of the year.
