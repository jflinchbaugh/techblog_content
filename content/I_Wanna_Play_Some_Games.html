<p>I'm occassionally intrigued by a game, but <a href = "http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000201.html">Cedric describes a couple games</a> that I'd really like to see, including Myst 4.  I didn't even know they were still producing Myst games.</p>
<p>I guess I should get a Windows box to play some games, but it seems like such a waste to actually buy real hardware for it.  If I'm going to spend real money on a machine, it should be a real Linux box. :)</p>
<p>I guess I could look at <a href = "http://www.transgaming.com/">TransGaming</a> to get these games running on my formidable Linux laptop, but even that may not be enough of a machine (only 32MB VRAM).  Maybe I should just arrange a play date with some Windows friends with big computers.</p>
<p>Hey Todd!  When's the next LAN party?</p>
