<p>Claire's headed off for her <a href = "http://manicmommies.com/2008/07/escape_08_cruise_to_the_bahama.html">Manic Mommies cruise</a> for the weekend, and I'm anticipating the rest of my weekend with the kids.  Paige has a half day of school, so I figured I'd just take Friday off.</p>
<p>I figure it's an opportunity to do the stuff she wasn't jumping to do, so I'm looking for some things to do with the kids and people to join us.</p>
<p>Here's my loose plan so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friday Afternoon: Green Dragon</li>
<li>Saturday: Strasburg Train Museum</li>
<li>Sunday Afternoon: Lancaster Science Factory</li>
</ul>
<p>Then everyone's back to school, day care, and work for Monday.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in joining us or have any additional ideas?  More kids are obviously welcome.</p>
