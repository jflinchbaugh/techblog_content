<p>I've implemented many of the neat little features that I wanted, and I've forgotten some (like a calendar).  My links are dynamically data driven now (kept in entity beans) with a nice little administration screen.  I have one final touch to add to allow myself to edit existing links (not just add or delete).</p>
<p>Here's my new list I'd like to get into next:</p>
<ol>
<li>XML parse/validate for articles and comments.  This will help me ensure XHTML compliance when I finally get my base code compliant.</li>
<li>Spell checking.  I've heard of a Java package called <a href = "http://jazzy.sf.net/">Jazzy</a>, but I think it may be GUI-based.  The worst case is setting up a servlet or session bean that executes ispell</li>
<li>A nice little Javascript trick to generate my Permalink name from the article Subject, so I don't have to do it myself, but I still get an opportunity to change it if I want.</li>
<li>A link to automatically validate a new article on the site with w3c's validator.</li>
<li>More versatile theming.</li>
<li>Decent plugin architecture more on par with Blojsom.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm guessing that I could make this thing pretty useful if I grow it into the CMS space.  <a href = "http://blojsom.sf.net/">Blojsom</a> and  <a href = "http://www.rollerweblogger.org/">Roller</a> have the java blog space pretty locked up in my opinion.  I'm not sure what I could do beyond what they already do, and if I really want an EJB backend, I could probably just code a nice fetcher backend to Blojsom and then code plugins for the rare feature I have here that Blojsom may not.</p>
