<p>When I bought my T616, I had quickly concluded that I should leave the bluetooth disabled to save the battery.  I'm finding now that when leaving it on and idle, the phone lasts 3 days on a charge instead of 4.  That's acceptable, so I'm not going to bother turning it off anymore.</p>
<p>I think my initial conclusion of it lasting only <em>1 day</em> with bluetooth can be blamed on the excessive use in that first week or two.</p>
