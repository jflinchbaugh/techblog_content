<p><a href = "http://dynaop.dev.java.net/">dynaop</a> is an Aspect-Oriented Programing (AOP) framework recently released by <a href = "http://crazybob.org">Bob Lee</a>.  Bob seems to be a big thinker in AOP, having been implementing it from the beginning, including a bit of the code in JBoss.</p>
<p>I'm posting this URL here, because at first glance, it seems to be a great introduction to the concepts of AOP and docs for a well-regarded AOP engine.  This is my own personal reminder to go back and study this when I can, so I can catch up with current innovations.  I've been reading about this everywhere, but I haven't wrapped my head around it yet, so I don't fully understand the new stuff as it develops.  It feels too much like my Calculus classes in college. :)</p>
