<p>Here's an article at <a href = "http://java.sun.com">Sun</a> introducing how to <a href = "http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/jconsole.html">use JConsole to monitor applications</a>.  I'll have to get back to this one and spend some quality time reading.</p>
<p>I've played briefly with JConsole during and after a JUG presentation on new features in J2SDK 5.0, and I was quite impressed with the pretty graphs and the lack of performance overhead incurred on my runing program, but it's been a while.  This article appears to present much more information than my previous 10 minutes with the tool.</p>
