<p>Claire and I got out to see <a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424345/">Clerks II</a> on Saturday.  It was pretty funny, but I had a bit of a headache, so that made parts feel a bit slow.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't quite as satisfying as I had hoped.  I guess these days, if I'm going to devote some time to something, even a couple hours, it should be teaching me something or changing the way I think about a subject.  I'm not sure.</p>
<p>It was definitely better than <em>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</em>.  Maybe some quotables and scenes will take hold in my brain, and I'll feel the movie was worth the exorbitant theater price.</p>
