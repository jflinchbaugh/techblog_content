<p>I seem to have cut much of my hair off.  I've regressed to the bowl-cut that I had nearly 8 years ago, and in one fairly quick transaction, I have no use for hair ties anymore.  That seems really odd.  I've had long hair for years.</p>
<p>I figured I needed a haircut, and I realized I didn't really care too much how it looked, so I just went for it.  I have not regretted it yet, and I doubt I will -- It looks alright, though I'm still out of style.  Oh well.  Now I need to dig up all my Concrete Blonde, Smiths, Jesus and Mary Chain, and feel like a kid again. (I'm not totally joking there.)</p>
<p>My employer is going to think I'm shopping for a new job or something. ;)</p>
