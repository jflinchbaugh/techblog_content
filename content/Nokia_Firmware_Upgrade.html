<p>Nokia's offering free <a href = "http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/softwareupdate">firmware updates</a> for their phones.  Reportedly, this is the <a href = "http://mobilecrunch.com/2006/08/24/nokia-unveils-phone-firmware-updater/">first carrier</a> to do this.  Maybe I'll need to look at Nokia phones next time I'm shopping.  I'd love to have a clear option for upgrades, instead of these sketchy schemes we have now for updating my SonyEricsson: mail-in-your-phone, or the buy credits, run this software, and hope it doesn't destroy your phone, and still not really have any clear guarantees as to what it'll accomplish for you.</p>
<p>I'm afraid to try a flash/unlock service for my phone, because I don't want to break it, and if I can't get the Java security completely unlocked, I don't want to lose that one set of certificates that does allow some software to access priveleged services.</p>
