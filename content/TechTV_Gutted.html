<p>Comcast seems to be <a href = "http://news.com.com/2100-1026_3-5207821.html?tag=nefd.top">gutting TechTV</a> completely.  I guess they just bought it to shut it down?  What they've done obviously doesn't make sense if they were really trying to draw the TechTV viewership.</p>
<p>Maybe it's not as bad as it sounds though, since it says they're posting the jobs back to the San Francisco staff who want to relocate to Los Angeles.  Maybe some of the key people will move, and the new programming they develop will tend less towards games.  Either way, it looks like I may soon get some of the old shows into my cable line-up.</p>
<p>Maybe I've become apathetic, but I don't feel like cancelling my cable over this yet.</p>
