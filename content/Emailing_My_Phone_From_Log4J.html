<p>I have JBoss' log4j configured to email my mobile phone using the <code>SMTPAppender</code>.  My SE W810i didn't seem to want to display the messages with stacktraces, though.  It said the message used an unsupported encoding.</p>
<p>By adding the <code>&lt;param name = "Encoding" value = "iso-8859-1"/&gt;</code> parameter to the appender configuration (<code>jboss-log4j.xml</code>), I forced the messages down to an encoding that my phone does understand, and now it works nicely.</p>
