<p>I'm not to have my notebook at work, so I'm scrambling to distribute my normal uses of my notebook onto my work PC and to websites.</p>
<p><a href = "http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> seems to work pretty well in place of <a href = "http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">Liferea</a>, and I've started using <a href = "http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> to suck down podcasts to my work machine.  That may actually mostly work, since that's where I end up doing most my listening anyway.  We'll see how it goes on weekends.</p>

<p><a href = "http://pidgin.im/pidgin/home/">Pidgin</a> is proving to be super-slick as well, since each account can have its own proxy settings.  I have it configured to do my work AIM account normally, and my personal Jabber account passes through a SSH-tunneled SOCKS5 connection.  The interface is very usable as well.  I had been using <a href = "http://psi-im.org/">Psi</a> for the longest time.</p>
<p>Finally, I've discovered that <a href = "http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest.com</a> has some features I've been wanting from mapping sites for a while.  One such feature is the <a href = "http://help.mapquest.com/jive/entry.jspa?externalID=45&amp;categoryID=6">"Places Nearby"</a> link.  I can just pop in a location, then have it just show me everything around me.  That's especially useful when you're just looking for random things to do in a new area.  You can further refine it by category or other search.</p>
<p>The "Places Nearby" feature isn't available through the normal WAP site right now, but I hope to see it in newer versions of the Java ME MapQuest client due out later this year.</p>
<p>I've also discovered that <a href = "http://www.adobe.org/">Adobe</a> has a free <a href = "http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/">Flex</a> compiler for producing Flash applications from Actionscript and MXML markup -- I've created my own little Flash apps now.</p>
