<p>My reading list has been getting longer recently.  I've had <a href = "http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/pattern.asp">William Gibson's <i>Pattern Recognition</i></a> and <a href = "http://www.cryptonomicon.com/">Neal Stephenson's <i>Cryptonomicon</i></a> laying around for a while, but haven't gotten to them.  (<i>Cryptonomicon</i> is just intimidating in its size.)</p>
<p>I also have a <i>WAP Servlets</i> book I've been browsing, and <a href = "http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471237124.html">Kevin Mitnick's <i>Art of Deception</i></a> which I bought recently.</p>

<p>Additionally, a beer afficionado friend of mine lent me <i>Michael Jackson's Guide to Beer</i> (no, not the King of Pop).  I hope to learn a bit about the components of beer and its taste, so I can better describe, note, remember, and recognize beers I like.</p>
<p>The list is destined to stay pretty long, since any time I might think about picking up a book (which is often recently), I end up instead doing server maintenance, laptop maintenance, house maintenance, cleaning, playing with Paige, or sleeping.  On computer things, I always have a list of systems I could improve, newly implement, or on which I just need to study a bit and stay current.  That, of course, brings me back to my technical reading list and magazines.</p>
<p>I'd also like to pick up Linus Torvalds' <i>Just for Fun</i>, but I guess I have enough on my list for now.  Beyond even that, I'd like to get around to the classics by Orwell, Asimov, Bradbury, Wells, etc.</p>
