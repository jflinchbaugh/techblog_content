<p>Looking back over the past couple weblog entries, I can see I've not been very productive in the technology or Java world.</p>
<p>I have been doing cool things at home and work though.</p>
<p>At home, this past weekend, I:
<ul>
<li>
patched the bare spots in the lawn with this odd  grass seed, fertilizer, dryer lint stuff from Scott's.
</li>
<li>
did a bit of rewiring at the breaker box to make room for future circuits to support more air conditioners this summer.
</li>
<li>
completed the deck (again!) -- covered the cinder blocks supporting the deck, and connected the 3 sets of deck outlets to power.
</li>
<li>
shopped lots -- We purchased most of a summer wardrobe for Paige at the cool Girls' Clothing Outlet in Columbia.
</li>
<li>
replaced my bike tire innertube, so now I can actually go biking.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I did eventually yesterday crash out and started to fall back into my more familiar immovable lump state.</p>
