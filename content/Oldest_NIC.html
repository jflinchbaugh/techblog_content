<p>I just swapped out one of he oldest NICs I have around here.  As I recollect, It's only 10-mbit and the first PCI NIC I bought.  It's been passed along from server to server starting in my old Pentium 200, and I finally pulled it from the Athlon 64 X2 yesterday.</p>
<p>10-mbit was enough to talk to the 6-mbit cablemodem, but finally, these later Linux kernels have been taking issue with it, causing it to drop interrupts and timeout.  Earlier kernels didn't do it as much, so I've taken it to mean that it may just not be keeping up well with recent changes in the ne2k-pci driver.  Replacing the NIC with a cheap 3COM card was just easier too.</p>
