<p>While installing a new kernel on my good old gentoo box, I disabled devfs to switch to udev.  It turns out that /dev is completely empty on disk, and I guess it used to be configured to mount /dev as devfs on boot.</p>
<p>With udev, that mount happens in userspace from scripts, so init got sort of unhappy and complained that it couldn't open a console (no devices yet), and I couldn't see any of the boot process until udev was up and the console <code>agetty</code>s started.</p>
<p>I had to boot the gentoo CD, mount my root partition, and create a few bootstrap devices, in particular, the console.  <code>/sbin/MAKEDEV console</code> seemed to get all the tty's in place and all was well then.  For good measure, I also created <code>/dev/null</code>, since it looked like something had tried to write to it anyway.</p>
<p>I have the 2.6.11.5 kernel running now, pretty painlessly.  You can really feel the speed increase on a p5-200!</p>
