<p>On Saturday night, my notebook locked up, so I rebooted it, and it just failed with a kernel OOPS somewhere in the VM code.</p>
<p>I suspected a corrupted swap space, so I booted the Knoppix CD, recreated my swap space (<code>mkswap -c</code>), and sure enough, there were a couple bad blocks in the middle.  It flagged them accordingly and works around them.</p>
<p>Following that, I needed to do a whole <code>reiserfsck --rebuild-tree</code> on my root partition before the machine would successfully boot.  Luckily the bad blocks are in the swap (which can flag and skip them) instead of the reiserfs (which cannot).</p>
<p>Once bad blocks start showing up, the drive is on its way out, so I created a login at IBM's website, logged a request, they called me back about 30 minutes later, but I missed the call.  I called back on Monday night around 10pm, talked to a tech, and they're shipping me a new drive, no charge, and a return-postage box included.  Disregarding the hassle of hardware failure, IBM is making the whole thing pretty easy -- no sitting on hold, and no low-tier tech support insisting I conduct a bunch of tests I already did.</p>
