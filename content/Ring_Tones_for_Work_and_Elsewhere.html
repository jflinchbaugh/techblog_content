<p>My biggest problem with my phone is finding a ringtone that is suitable for work and the car.</p>
<p>I have it on vibrate, and I use an obnoxious <a href = "http://www.zedge.no/index.php?side=lyder&amp;getsound=162">beeping ring</a>, so I might actually hear it in the car.  This ring is sort of obnoxious for quieter environments, like work.  It does its own little volume stepping, but it gets loud quickly.  My phone's stepping volume is sort of screwy in that it only steps up to half-volume, not full-volume.  At least it's not one of the "party in my pants" song ringtones.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any recommendations for a good stepping ring appropriate for the office, but audible in the car?</p>
