<p>I often find myself standing around with my phone for a few minutes wanting something to do, but I don't usually want a game!  I need something like Amazon's <a href = "http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Mechanical Turk</a> to break work into tiny units of work, and let me do each bit in these spare moments.</p>
<p>Introduce a framework to distribute anyone's work (and money) to people with spare moments with their mobiles, and you have the Mobile Mechanical Turk!</p>
<p>What units of work are appropriate for the small screen and short windows of time?  Surveys with only a few questions seem like a logical choice.</p>
<p>I guess plain RSS reading on the phone could serve my purposes, but this isn't really synchronized with my normal desktop reader, so there's the problem of overlap.</p>
