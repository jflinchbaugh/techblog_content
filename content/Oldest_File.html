<p><a href = "http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> is running a <a href = "http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=1256&amp;aid=-1">poll asking your earliest legitimate file timestamp</a>.  I'd obviously have to look at butterfly, since those files have been carried over for years and years from old machines, etc.</p>
<p>I found a <code>.ztalkrc</code> configuration file timestamped 1996 -- That's nearly 9 years old!  That must have been one of the first Linux things I tried.</p>
<p>It took a bit of Googling, but <a href = "http://www.bahneman.com/liem/work/ztalk.html">ZTalk</a> was a very early voice over IP toy.  I don't recall actually getting it to work.  Dinger, I would have been talking to you -- Did we get that to work?</p>
