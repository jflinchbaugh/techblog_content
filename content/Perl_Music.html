<p>When I used to regularly frequent clubs and parties, I'd occasionally bring my notebook out and just chill in the corner coding.  Via <a href = "http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>, I saw this article about <a href = "http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/08/31/livecode.html">Hacking Perl in Nightclubs</a>.  It's not about people like me, but a musician using Perl scripts to sequence and perform music.</p>
<p>I've always been curious about this sort of thing.  On more than one occassion, I've installed the latest free software offerings of trackers and music sequencers to see what I could do, but I've never gotten far.  The tools seem to have come a long way.  I've installed Supercollider and Ecasound as this article happens to mention, but when I get around to actually playing with them, I doubt I'll find my musical ability has progressed much beyond my 4 years playing a trumpet.  I can appreciate music, but I don't understand all the complex structures, and the music that interests me most seems to have redefined all the rules.</p>
