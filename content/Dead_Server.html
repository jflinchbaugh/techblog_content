<p>My home server which hosted most of my Java sites crashed a couple times last week then just decided to stop booting after a while.  My theory is that it's a victim of nearly 4 years of thermal abuse -- a dual athlon in a room that could sometimes reach 80 degrees fahrenheit or above in these transitional months between winter and air-conditioned summer.</p>
<p>I emailed <a href = "http://www.rimuhosting.com">Rimu Hosting</a> and had them beef up my VPS I have with them, and I moved most everything out there over the couple days that followed.  Everything seems to be running nicely out there, so now I must question how much of a server I really need here in the house.  While planning my next server, I've had to drop back to the trusty 10-year-old p5-200 to serve as the firewall.</p>
<p>All in all, crashing servers and emergency migrations are quite stressful and distracting from the normal daily activities, but it's affording me the opportunity to do some things I should have done a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>Update (26 April 2006):</strong>
I may miss my old serve a bit.</p>
