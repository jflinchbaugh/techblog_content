<p>Colo prices are expensive.  Everytime I get nervous about keeping my website up on my "residential" connection, I wonder about colocation.  Finally, I think I may have a reasonable option -- <a href = "http://www.pdxcolo.net/">PDXcolo.net</a>.
These guys look pretty interesting, much like us, extreme linux geeks trying to do cool things and not necessarily profiteering.</p>
<p>I could get a nice little virtual server, setup DNS there, and then I'll have my DNS completely under my control again for whatever whacky schemes I formulate.  I figure I could even fit a nice apache and jboss instance out there.  I could probably even put my mail out there.  Then I'd have some bandwidth, and a stable location without the hacks to make it appear static.</p>
<p>That then leaves me wondering why I need my big huge dual athlon server.  I'd hate to not have it, but I already work remotely to it almost all the time, so what's the big deal if I move everything to another server to use remotely?</p>
<p>It's tempting, but not entirely necessary at the moment, so I guess I'll wait.  I think it'll make an excellent back up plan though should I run into any snags in my current arrangements.  Who would be interested in sharing a virtual server with me?  We could get a couple of them, cluster them, whatever.  Who knows?  We could be neighbors on the same hardware! :)</p>
