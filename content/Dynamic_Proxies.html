<p>DevX has an article on <a href = "http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/21463">dynamic proxies</a> provided by J2SE.  They claim it's the first step to understanding AOP, and I think it does shed some light and give you a simple starting point to understanding where the AOP folks are taking us.</p>

<p>I was in the process of experimenting with writing a static proxy to wrap JDBC interfaces, but I may be able to implement it this way, instead, if I can probably understand dynamic proxies.  It looks powerful and not even all that complex, but i suspect I'll find the complexities once I start playing.</p>
