<p>Since the <a href = "http://www.debian.org/News/2003/20031121">server compromise</a> back on 21 November 2003, Debian's archives have been pretty static.</p>
<p>It seems that they're serving updates again, so I'm back on my adventurous and rapid update schedule.  It's been a rough and stagnant period. :)</p>
<p>Actually, who do I know that still runs Debian?  It seems like many have moved onto gentoo.</p>
