<p>Some people may have noticed that I moved <a href = "http://weblogs.hjsoft.com/blojsom/blog/paige/">Paige's Weblog</a>.  Come July 4th or so, the old <em>baby.hjsoft.com</em> site will no longer be <em>specific</em> enough to mean <em>Paige</em>.  We will have a second kid!  Notes on the new baby experience will be found at <a href = "http://weblogs.hjsoft.com/blojsom/blog/baby/">http://weblogs.hjsoft.com/blojsom/blog/baby/</a>.</p>
