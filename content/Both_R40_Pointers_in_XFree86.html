<p>I figured out how to get both pointer devices on my R40 working to their fullest capacities.  When I switched to the Synaptics driver to get all the slick touchpad features, I lost my trackpoint.  This wasn't a big deal, since I don't use the trackpoint, but it <em>does</em> have 3 buttons, so it could be nice to have.  I just got it working now by adding a second pointer and using the 2 different input mouse devices.</p>

<p>Here's an excerpt from my XF86Config-4:</p>
<pre>Section "ServerLayout"
    ...

    InputDevice    "TrackPoint" "CorePointer"

EndSection</pre>
<p><b>Update (27 May 2005):</b>
A couple months ago, I found that my trackpoint stopped functioning some time along the way.  It seems that a newer kernel (I'm at 2.6.12-rc5 currently) managed to bump the trackpoint from <code>mouse1</code> to <code>mouse2</code>.  With that adjustment to my XF86Config-4 file, I have the trackpoint, and more importantly, the top 3 buttons functioning again.</p>
