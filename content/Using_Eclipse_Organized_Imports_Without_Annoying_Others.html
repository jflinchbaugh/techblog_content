<p>I found a neat little trick in Eclipse 3.3 which will keep my TextMate-using coworkers happier with me.</p>
<p>Eclipse' Organize Imports (Ctrl-Shift-O) is handy for quickly finding and adding an import for a class you just started using in your code, but the default behavior is to list out each class in a long list of explicit imports.  Users of text editors may hate you for always replacing their <code>import java.util.*;</code> with your convenient little keystrokes.</p>

<p>Wildcard imports <em>can</em> be accomodated and generated from Eclipse by changing a preference.  Open <strong>Window menu -&gt; Preferences window -&gt; Java -&gt; -> Code Style -&gt; Organize Imports</strong> and change the <em>Number of imports needed for .*</em> options down to 1.  Then importing just one class from a package will result in an <code>import package.*;</code>, which your project mates may appreciate more.</p>
