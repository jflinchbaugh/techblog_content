<p>I've been looking at <a href = "http://friendfeed.com/jflinchbaugh/">FriendFeed</a> a bit this weekend. They seem to actually roll out new features, and I have a feeling that feeds may update more often.</p>
<p>Development is very important to me, because I get bored looking at the same old application for too long, so this thing could be interesting.  Jaiku, in the meantime, hasn't seen any interesting changes in months, and feed retrieval feels slower and slower.</p>
<p>If I jump, and my friends don't right away, it's OK, because I've already created them as imaginary friends on FriendFeed, meaning I added them with their feeds, so I can still see them. I've also managed to hook up a few 3rd-party apps, like <a href = "http://www.imified.com/">IMified</a> and <a href = "http://fftogo.com/">FF-to-go</a>.  After figuring out to ignore friend-of-friend traffic, I think I may be able to use FF-to-go without it burying me in reading.</p>
<p>I ultimately still want a more distributed system to do this stuff, but this thing may address the current pain points I have with Jaiku.  We'll see if I stay here or not -- I always hear that ultimately, it comes down to where your friends are.</p>
