<p>Thanks Stacey for testing the new site in Internet Exploder (ah, first-hand experience now) and informing me of the shambles it was in.  This version should be better.   It's still not perfect though, it should be presentable in IE again.  It still has no tables. :)</p>
<p>So who's gonna hit me now with Opera? Lynx and WAP browsers should find it reasonable to navigate.</p>
<p>Now I can move onto adding a few new fields, and a history viewer.</p>
