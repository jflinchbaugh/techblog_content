<p>Dinger's candidate of choice, <a href = "http://www.badnarik.org/supporters/blog/">Michael Badnarik</a> turns out to be a master of deception like the rest of his opponents.</p>
<p>At the bottom of his weblog, there's a W3C tag falsely purporting XHTML 1.0 compliance, but <a href = "http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.badnarik.org%2Fsupporters%2Fblog%2F">W3C's own validator</a> (linked by that stolen tag) tells the real story.  Politics is all about lies.</p>
<p>I know lying about mere markup languages seems trivial, but it represents a pattern.  If elected president, these half truths will grow into more elaborate schemes and we'll end up invading Canada for spying on us all these years.  That's right, before we know it, Celine Dion and Sarah McLachlan will be dubbed covert Canadian terrorist operatives!  Stop Badnarik before it's too late!</p>
