<p>I've recently finished reading Kevin Mitnick's <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/076454280X/qid=1110464227/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-5542370-8253551?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Art of Deception</a>.  It's a collection of stories to demonstrate the security risks of social engineering attacks on the human elements of an organization.  It's an entertaining read, but it felt a little repetitive and slow at points, since it's not as densely packed with information as my normal technical reading. With all the recent news about data aggregation companies having <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4529286">data stolen</a>, this book does feel very relevant.</p>
<p>It'll elevate your paranoia level a bit, which is good, and you easily recognize things you should do differently.  Each little story has an explanation of what happened and what could have been done to prevent it.</p>
<p>The end of the book is geared toward people who design security policies for organizations, so it's a bit dry, but I'm sure valuable for those people.</p>
