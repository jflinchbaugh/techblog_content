<p>Braden brought a couple of his trucks out to the sand court for his four-year photos, and we sat and played a bit while I shot.  He also ran in circles a bit to get his mother a bit wound up, but we were still doing fine -- I only needed a few good shots, and I managed plenty.</p>
<p>From my gear bag, I used the small satin umbrella to bounce the strobe onto the scene, often crossing the sun which dappled into our mostly-shaded scene. For Braden, I also packed a bonus toy -- a <em>real</em> folding shovel, so we could do some <em>real</em> digging.  This provided a good change of pace, and it was the perfect height to aid in posing his hands when he was seated on a truck.</p>
