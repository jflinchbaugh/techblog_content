<p>OK, well maybe I don't rule everything, but I have crafted a bit of javascript into the site now that squishes and stretches the absolute <code>div</code>s into their correct sizes.  Now the site won't look quite like crap in IE.</p>
<p>I basically grab the middle of the layout and set its height to that of the left panel if the left is longer than the content (stretch).  For the stars, I loop through all the content <code>div</code>s, and set the stars <code>div</code> to the height of the content <code>div</code> (squish).</p>
<p>I thank Carlos for getting me pointed more precisely in the right direction.</p>
