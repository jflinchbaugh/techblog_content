<p>Over Father's Day weekend, we went camping at <a href = "http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/parks/lakefairfax/ffxphotos.htm">Lake Fairfax Park</a> in Reston, VA.  It was a great trip, and we found lots to do even in a bit of rain.</p>

<p>The park itself was nice and clean, and it had a water park -- Paige and Ben were pretty independent floating around the various pools and toys in their little life vests.  I even got in the water to play a bit and to float around the cool lazy river.</p>
<p>We didn't stay at the campground long, though, since the place is located conveniently near the <a href = "http://www.nasm.si.edu/UdvarHazy/">Udvar Hazy Air and Space Museum</a> on the edge of the Dulles Airport, and we were about 20 minutes from a Metro stop.  We also found restaurants and other things we needed within a few miles of the park.</p>
<p>Udvar Hazy is amazing, since it's huge!  There's an SR-71, a <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Trips/2009-06-20_Washington_DC/DSC_9118_01.jpg.html">Concorde</a>, and even an entire <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Trips/2009-06-20_Washington_DC/DSC_8919_01.jpg.html">Space Shuttle</a>. We picked a good day to be there, since it was their Family Become a Pilot day or something, so the place had lots of activities for the kids.  It's also indoors, so that was useful in Saturday morning's thunderstorms.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we grabbed breakfast and hopped the Metro down to the Smithsonian Museums.  We checked out primarily the Museum of American History, then walked the mall down to the new World War 2 Memorial and to the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
<p>Paige was quite <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Trips/2009-06-20_Washington_DC/DSC_9508_01.jpg.html">excited</a> about the Lincoln Memorial, since she had learned about Lincoln in school.  I think I'm supposed to send a copy of the photo of her at the monument to her Kindergarten teacher or something.</p>
<p>Everyone got to play in the water, see lots of stuff, and I came back with a <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Trips/2009-06-20_Washington_DC">photo or two</a>, so the trip was a great success.</p>
