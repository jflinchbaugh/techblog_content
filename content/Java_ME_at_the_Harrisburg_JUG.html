<p>I gave a quick little talk at last night's <a href = "http://www.harrisburgjug.org/display/JUG/2007-03-15+Extending+JUnit">JUG meeting</a> on porting game code to run in Java ME.  For demonstration, I ported a little <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout">BreakOut</a> game from the previous meeting.</p>
<p>I think it went well enough, but I can tell that people still don't grasp the potential of running software on your phone.  There are still too many people just thinking, "I have a phone to make phone calls.".</p>
<p>I was hoping to do more presentations on Java ME, but I guess I won't yet.  Maybe I'll keep doing these short talks to keep it in people's minds.</p>
