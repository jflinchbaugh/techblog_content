<p>The United States government has been hard at work coming up with cute names for their newest legislation.  After 6 years of hard work, they've carefully crafted the latest cute name -- <a href = "http://news.com.com/2100-1028_3-5116940.html?tag=nefd_top">CAN-SPAM</a>.  Victory is imminent!</p>
<p>Wasn't Hormel all pissed anyway about their product name being used this way?  That's why we came up with "<b>U</b>nsolicited <b>C</b>ommercial <b>E</b>mail".  It strikes me as inconsiderate that the government insists upon using the name as well.  Aren't they supposed to ultimately be politically correct?</p>
