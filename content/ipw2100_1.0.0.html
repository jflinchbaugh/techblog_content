<p>The <a href = "http://ipw2100.sf.net/">Intel ProWireless 2100 drivers</a> have hit a 1.0 release, so I thought I'd cleanup the way I use them.</p>
<p>Initial versions of the driver didn't handle suspend, so I unloaded and reloaded them all the time.  I also didn't want the radio powered all the time, so I blacklisted the module from hotplug as  well, so I could load it by hand and configure the interface from a script.</p>
<p>I no longer need to reload the current version of the driver, so I'm letting hotplug load it.  I still don't want the radio on by default, though, so I configured modprobe to load the ipw2100 module with the <code>disable=1</code>.  I still use my scripts to bring the interface up and down in different environments, but the script uses the <code>sys</code> interface to enable and disable the radio, which is much faster than loading and unloading the module.</p>
<pre>#enable
echo 0 > /sys/class/net/eth1/device/rf_kill
#disable
echo 1 > /sys/class/net/eth1/device/rf_kill</pre>
<p>Next I'd like to figure out a way to maybe allow it to automatically switch the wireless on and off depending upon the presence of the wired link.</p>
