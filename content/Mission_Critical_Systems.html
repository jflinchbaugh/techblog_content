<p>Last night, Claire ordered a pizza online from <a href = "http://www.papajohns.com/">Papa John's</a>.  I had been in a rather bad mood, but I found myself incredibly amused when I arrived at Papa John's and the pizza was there and ready.  I know internet pizza is just so <i>1999</i>, but for some reason it just seems like a really high expectation of which the local pizza chain could fall disappointingly short.</p>

<p>The weird thing is that I don't question the building of mission critical systems and trusting computers to reliably do other very important things.  Timely food delivery just doesn't seem possible.  I'm not sure what I perceive to be missing.  Maybe I just don't trust the people on the receiving end to understand the stream of <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s that represent my hunger and deepest needs.</p>
