<p>Doug likes when I point out blog enhancements, so I'll note that I've added a little block on the left that shows the last comment posted to any article.  I've also made comments preview first, then the second time you hit <i>Submit</i>, it'll save it.  This should keep Doug from posting really badly formatted HTML in the future.</p>


<p>I've also pulled many of the field labels and java block comment-style border characters into the application.properties file, so they can be made to go away or change if desired. (If the darkside gets me and I want to make it look like VB, I can change the borders to apostrophe characters.)</p>
<p>Next, I think I'll look into implementing metadata (users, topics, links) management, so some of this can be made more dynamic, or maybe implement <i>trackback</i> to help link articles together, since I'm often commenting or referring to others' weblogs.</p>
