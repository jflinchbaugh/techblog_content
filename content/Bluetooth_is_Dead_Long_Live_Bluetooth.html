<p>It's funny to see articles today <a href = "http://blogs.zdnet.com/ITFacts/?p=11290">exclaiming how 55 million bluetooth headsets</a> will ship this year, when just 3 years ago, <a href = "http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20031013S0040">everyone knew it was dead</a>.</p>
<p>I've been <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/searchArticles.java?search=bluetooth">using bluetooth</a> for its mobile data networking since about the time of its death, and I really was concerned for a bit -- there weren't many bluetooth phones from which to choose, and the ones that did exist were considerably more expensive.  Today, it's much more common, since everyone wants the wireless hands-free kit.  My <a href = "http://www.prius.com/">next car</a> will probably have bluetooth as well.</p>
<p>I'm very pleased that the personal-area-network has finally become useful for the normal people.  Now I just hope that the manufacturers don't let the data side of the devices slip in favor of only supporting voice services, like some <a href = "http://www.verizonwireless.com/">errant carriers</a> try to do.</p>
