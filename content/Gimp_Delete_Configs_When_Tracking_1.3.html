<p>I've been following Gimp 1.3 for several months (as long as Debian has tracked it).  It's been working pretty nicely, and I've made it my primary image tool.</p>
<p>In the past couple pre-2.0 releases, I've found that the '1' shortcut key for 100% zoom would trigger that function even outside the image window. In particular, it would happen in the select tool window where I was trying type '1280' into the fixed-ratio rectangular select.  This kept me from actually typing a '1' in any fields, so I'd have to unbind the hotkey to use it -- quite obnoxious.</p>
<p>I was about to file a bug against it, but I first decided to just blow away my .gimp-1.3/ directory and let the program rebuild it from scratch.  This fixed the problem!</p>
<p>Additionally, I got the new default dialog layout which puts all the really useful dialogs into 2 windows on the screen.  I haven't taken the time to really figure out exactly how the dockable windows work to set that sort of thing up for myself.  The default does things I didn't even know were possible.</p>
<p>It's probably good advice to try resetting configurations when tracking through multiple versions of development/unstable software.  (Reinstalling works for Windows users, so why shouldn't the rule be applied to any other unstable system?  ;) )</p>
