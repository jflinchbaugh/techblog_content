Upon the release
of Pop OS 20.10,
my https://system76.com/[System76] laptop
and my Arris router
started having some disagreements.
The laptop would drop connection
every couple hours
and not reconnect itself.
I'd see the little question mark
in the WIFI indicator,
and I needed to manually turn WIFI
off and back on
to restore the connection.

I found mentions of this behavior
in Ubuntu and in Pop OS forums,
and supposedly newer NetworkManager
from Gnome would fix it,
so I suffered and waited
for the beta of Pop OS 21.04
to be available.
That didn't fix it,
so I started digging around some more
in System76's page for
https://support.system76.com/articles/wireless[Troubleshooting Wireless].

I picked my way through the tips
and applied some of them.
Disabling *band steering*
in the router
finally seems to have fixed the problem.
I've kept my WIFI connection up and running
for days now.
I didn't need to name
the 5GHz and 2.4GHz networks differently.
