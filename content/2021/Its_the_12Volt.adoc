=== The Symptoms

In the https://www.facebook.com/groups/BMWi3[BMW i3 Worldwide Group]
on Facebook,
there are a few recurring jokes,
and one of the most popular
is the 12-volt battery causing
every little weird issue.
One could wonder
why it has a 12-volt battery at all,
since the 400-some-volt battery
should be able to power the accessories.
Additionally,
BMW cars have a complicated charging system
that requires registration
when the battery is replaced,
so it's easy to understand why one might put off dealing with it.
The dealers can charge crazy amounts of money
for replacement.

My 2014 i3 has an occasional
annoyance I attribute possibly
to that little 12-volt battery:
sometimes forgetting its presets
and bluetooth pairing.
The more obvious warning
is that the battery has discharged while sitting,
and while it's not clear on the screen,
it means the 12-volt battery.
Mine did it for a couple cold days,
so I figured I was due to replace the battery,
but the warning stopped,
so I thought I might have had some more time.

Over the weekend,
I got to see the spectacular (and expected) failure
of the car due to the 12-volt battery going very low.
I opened the back hatch,
stowed all my worldly possessions
in the back,
closed it,
and then the alarm started whistling,
and I could not get anything unlocked
or stopped
by the key fob.
The alarm stopped
on its own,
but I still couldn't get into the car,
and I could see the taillights 
lowly blinking,
so it seemed to be the dreaded 12-volt battery.

The alarm went again
and later the horn while I worked.
Nothing inside the car would respond either.
This was the failure
about which the group warned:
it can't do anything, and you'll need it dragged
onto a rollback!
The car charges the 12-volt battery when running,
but without the 12-volt battery,
the car can't get any
of its smarts going to even power up the car.
They've managed to engineer a problem
of old cars into the new.

=== The Familiar Fix

I learned to pry off the cover
to use the mechanical key
and to manually pop the hood.
I figured I may as well try
to get it power
with one of those Lithium Ion
jump-starter packs I had on hand.
(I carry it in the car,
so I can still be helpful when others need a start.)
I pulled the velcro covers
and removed the allen and star screws
from the bin and removed the bin,
so I could _mostly_ get to the battery.
I could just barely fit the little
battery clamps in place
on the battery terminals.
I turned on the battery pack,
the car clicked,
and everything came back to life.
I knew I couldn't drive with that battery pack there,
so I let it charge for 10-15 minutes,
turned it off,
and found the car still functioned,
so I removed the battery pack,
and hit the road
to drop the car
at my local independent shop
to have the battery replaced.

A jump-starter _did_ turn out to be useful
with the i3,
and it saved me a tow for a problem
that shouldn't be so catastrophic.
