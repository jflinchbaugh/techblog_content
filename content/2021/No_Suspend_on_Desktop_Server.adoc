I have a desktop server
running Debian Unstable
in the house,
and I occasionally reboot it
without logging
back into the local desktop session.
If I don't login,
I'd later find the machine mysteriously inaccessible -- asleep.
It's set to never sleep,
but that's when I'm logged in.

To disable sleep in the GDM3 Greeter,
I edited the `/etc/apt/greeter.dconf-defaults`,
found the "Automatic suspend"/`[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power]`
section and followed the comments to add:
----
sleep-inactive-ac-timeout=0
----

Now the machine
will act a little more
like it's a server.
