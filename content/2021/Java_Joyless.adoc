Mr Haki has a
https://blog.mrhaki.com/2021/01/java-joy-transform-stream-of-strings-to.html[Java Joy article]
about transforming a stream of strings
into a map using functional Java.
I'm having a bit of trouble
embracing it enthusiastically,
since each example is 81 lines
of Java code
and a pointy pile
of type declarations!

I dashed out the same functionality
in 4 lines of Clojure,
and I can understand it
a whole lot easier.
I'm not even sure this is the fewest forms,
but it's still nicer.

    ["language" "clojure" "username" "john"]
    (partition 2)
    (reduce (fn [m [k v]] (assoc m k v)) {}))
  ;; => {"language" "clojure", "username" "john"}
