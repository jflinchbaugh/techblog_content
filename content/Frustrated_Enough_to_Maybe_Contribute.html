<p>I have a few severe irritations with the state of my computer right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>swsusp still causes occassional lockups on my ThinkPad R40.  I've already rebuilt 2.6.14.3 8 times trying to find the configuration that causes the problem.</li>
<li>Rhythmbox interacts poorly with esound and causes Rhythmbox to become unresponsive.</li>
<li>Rhythmbox has a good music library interface, but I want an option to show the file name, so I can differentiate podcasts and ripped streams that don't embed that info into their metadata.</li>
<li>Automount on my notebook refuses to expire the NFS mounts it used to do backups overnight.  The server does it just fine.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm frustrated enough with these things that I may soon be motivated to dig in, focus, and try to debug and fix them myself.  Then I can contribute the patches back to the projects or at least document my configuration problems and how I fixed it.</p>
