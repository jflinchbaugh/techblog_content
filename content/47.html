<p>Pretty painlessly, I just upgraded JBoss to 3.2.2 and J2SDK to 1.4.2_02.  This JBoss install is actually using Tomcat instead of Jetty for the web tier, but it makes no difference to my application.  Both are pretty standards-compliant, so they both behave the same in all the important ways.</p>
