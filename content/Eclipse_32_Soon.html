<p>I've been running Eclipse 3.2M6 for a while, but haven't felt like investing the time in installing M7, so I've just been waiting.  I have tiny little nags with Eclipse, but nothing I'd really bother mentioning.  I think I'm in the software upgrade rat race just to see something new, and to see if it just does something slicker.  I'd like to get my workstation and notebook synced up again with a shiny new version of Eclipse.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day and probably tomorrow I'll be watching (reload, reload, reload...) the Eclipse website like one watches a shipping tracker for that new piece of hardware.  This odd anticipation also manifests as an obsession with clicking on every mention of 3.2 that I see on java.blogs and other Java news sites.</p>
