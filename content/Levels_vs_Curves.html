<p>I thought I was all super-slick adjusting Levels on my images instead of using Brightness/Contrast, but now I'm experimenting with a new technique using Levels.  I had the pleasure of watching a little <a href = "http://www.callforhelptv.com/callforhelp/guests/0230A.shtml">Call for Help segment</a> on G4 one Saturday morning, and Alex Lindsay explained the basics of Levels compared to Curves.  I think I've managed to reproduce my old results and gone beyond to work even more precisely.</p>
<p>I have yet to see if it'll speed or slow my editing process.  I don't think I can afford to get any slower -- I'll never get photos posted.</p>
<p>I'm currently in the process of rescuing pictures of the Bass Bin Halloween party from the dark depths of under-exposure.  Raves always make good subjects for lots of correction.</p>
