<p>California fires have me thinking of all the stuff I'd lose should my place burn down.  I think I'd be in relatively good shape if I could grab my stack of hard drives and run.  Of course, all these drives are securely mounted in monsterous, heavy full-tower cases.  I'd surely perish, with my <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/">memories</a> and my data trying to lug them out.</p>

<p>I currently backup this stuff to a separate box, but it's sitting right next to the other server on the same fire-vulnerable desk.  I should get a monster USB-IDE drive, so I can grab it and run.</p>
<p>Another more likely solution is offsite backups.  Anyone want to trade space?  I'll hold somem of your stuff, if you hold mine?</p>
<p>Pushing 1.5G (and growing) of pictures out my cablemodem could be problematic (about 17hrs of problematic by my calculations), so I guess I should just burn a couple CDs and drop them at a friends house, since those are pretty static.</p>
<p>So, seriously, anyone want to do backups?</p>
