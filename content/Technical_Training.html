<p>Over at the <a href = "http://www.jroller.com/page/fate/20031119#the_joy_of_training_programs">BileBlog</a>, Hani denounces the value of any training program.  I have to say that I've been to some very worthwhile trainings, though with the tone of his post, I'd be embarassed to post that as a comment on his blog.</p>
<p>Sun's <a href = "http://training.sun.com/US/catalog/courses/FJ-310.html">FJ-310: Developing J2EE Compliant Applications</a> course was an excellent introduction and jumpstart in J2EE.  I had been studying it on my own for some months, but this course really showed me the big picture, and from there I could understand why I was doing this and how it could be applied.  My studies following that training had a much more productive direction.  It was just what I needed to get my traction and stop spinning my wheels.</p>
<p>Not all training is worthless, and I'm grateful that my employer at the time sent me.  I'd highly recommend that course to any savvy beginner.</p>
