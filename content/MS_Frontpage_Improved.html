<p>Browsing other weblogs, I found a link to a <a href = "http://ads.osdn.com/?ad_id=2026&alloc_id=2509&site_id=2&request_id=2948629&1076027963680">real ad</a> showing just how much MS FrontPage has improved.  I copied it <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/~glynis/fp_ad.gif">here</a> as well, because it's bound to disappear from OSDN's ad server.</p>
<p>If you don't see the humor, watch a couple more cycles of the animation.  <i>That's right, we said FrontPage."</i></p>
