<p>Looking back, it seems that I started moving to Lancaster back in 1992.  Before MP3, streaming audio, or even internet access, I used to scour the low end of the FM radio dial for something worth my listening.  I primarily found <a href = "http://www.wixq.com/">WIXQ</a> 91.7 from <a href = "http://www.millersville.edu/">Millersville University</a>, but I expect I also found WFNM 89.1 of <a href = "http://www.fandm.edu/index.xml">Franklin and Marshall College</a>.  York supposedly had a college station as well, but its transmitter was apparently poorly placed for it to reach my house to the East.</p>
<p>If I strung antenna wires from corner to corner of my bedroom or up the side of the house, I could get a mostly clear signal from WIXQ, and I had a much wider conduit of all that great <em>alternative</em> music of the time.  From a powerful 30 second clip of sound, I discovered the <a href = "http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jesus+and+Mary+Chain">Jesus and Mary Chain</a>, and I moved on to watching MTV's <a href = "http://www.altmusictv.com/120/archive.html">120 Minutes</a>, etc.</p>
<p>In 1994, when it came time to look around for colleges, Millersville was obviously familiar, so I visited and found an excellent computer science program with intriguing resources, so I was sold.  Millersville was the only place I applied.</p>
<p>I was fortunately accepted, commuted furiously from York to Millersville for nearly 5 years. I spent more time on campus (in the computer labs) over time, until I was nearly living there, and only returning home for showers and a few more hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Lancaster has always felt more metropolitan to me  -- there was just more culture there.  The clubs, education, people, shopping, and the downtown city drew me in.  Great independent restaurants remain to be a huge attraction to this area.</p>
<p>In the end, I officially moved into Claire's apartment around graduation in 2000, and now I own a house and rear a family near Millersville.  It's been a long road.</p>
<p><em>(The inspiration for writing this isn't as random as one may think: I've recently rediscovered that all the college stations in my area are again worth tuning.  This time, WFNM has been keeping my attention, and <a href = "http://www.xpn.org/">WXPN</a> has a transmitter in Harrisburg as well.)</em></p>
