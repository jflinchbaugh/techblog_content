<p>I'm getting much more comfortable with the strobes, so I've been using them more in everyday situations, like candid photos at Christmas gatherings.</p>
<p>I had the <a href = "http://strobist.blogspot.com/2007/12/christmas-game-plan-results.html">Strobist Christmas Morning setup</a> in mind most of the time, so I usually just laid a strobe or 2 in a high spot in a corner and pointed it at the ceiling.  Sometimes they'd all fire, sometimes not, so there was some unintentional variety.  In most of the photos, I was again too lazy to color correct the strobe, so I had a bit of white balance work on my hands in post-processing.</p>

When I was shooting for the opposite side of the room, I just needed to remember to open up the aperture a bit.</p>

It was looking good on the camera LCD, but I didn't look close enough at the histograms to see that I was under-exposing by 2 stops.  In the end, these shots were my worst, because they had so much noise from adjusting the exposure on the computer.  The setup worked pretty nicely, though.</p>
<p>I'm definitely getting the strobes to do mostly what I want them to do.</p>
