<p>I've recently discovered the <a href = "http://www.itconversations.com/index.html">IT Conversations</a> podcast feed.  It's a network of podcasts on various topics. It includes some news, but the most interesting parts I've found so far have been lectures and keynotes from conferences.  The content is amazing!  It's almost as good as being able to attend these speeches.</p>
<p>I'm currently listening to an excellent lecture with <a href = "http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail770.html">Oded Shenkar</a> speaking about the growth of the Chinese economy.</p>
