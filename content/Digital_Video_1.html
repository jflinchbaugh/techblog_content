<p>I'm now the proud owner of a <a href = "http://www.canondv.com/zr65mc/zr65mc_flash.html">Canon ZR65MC</a> mini-DV camera, a <a href = "http://www.samsung.com/Products/Camcorder/Mini_DV/Camcorder_Mini_DV_SCD27.htm">Samsung SCD27</a> mini-DV camera, and a no-name Firewire (IEEE1394) card with useless Windows software.</p>
<p>Even though it appears that I'm wired for internet porn production, have no fear, we're just evaluating cameras and making <a href = "http://baby.hjsoft.com/">Paige</a> a STAR!</p>
<p>Paige does cute things everyday.  We've been able to capture some of it in <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Paige_Marie_Flinchbaugh">still photos</a>, but we're really missing the cute little motions and SOUNDS!  Someday, we'll want to look back and and show Paige when she used to be cute (before she was a know-it-all teenager and not as cute).</p>
<p>So, back to the equipment, watch this space for reviews as we play with these things.  One camera is destined to return to <a href = "http://www.circuitcity.com/">Circuit City</a>.</p>
<p>After our first night of playing, the Canon has a nicer display and feels sturdier (heavier), but the Samsung seems easier to use and navigate, has more features, is lighter, and costs less.  Admittedly, I have not cracked any manuals for either camera yet.  I haven't installed the Firewire card yet, either.</p>
