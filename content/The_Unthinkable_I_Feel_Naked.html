<p>I must have been really tired this morning.  It's like that dream where you go to school not wearing clothes.</p>
<p>I walked out the door today without my laptop bag, and I didn't notice it until about 30 minutes into my drive.  There was no turning back.  My brain has obviously fallen out.  Such a thing has never before happened.</p>
<p>So, today I have no music, though Claire was kind enough to put the machine up on the network, so I can at least get to my code on my laptop.  I'm just stuck in windows completely today. :(  It could be worse though -- at least <b>my</b> web servers are still running without incident.</p>
<p>How's that for baiting the subject?</p>
