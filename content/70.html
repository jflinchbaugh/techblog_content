<p>I'm stretching the left side of this page a bit.  We have the pager, referers, blogs, and now my web comics I read.  You know everything about me now.  (Well, technically, I guess I should add my new links as well.)</p>
<p>Also, don't forget to heed my advice and install Mozilla Firebird.  You'll also find that lynx does a better job of dealing with my stylesheets than Internet Explorer does. :)  The poor IE users will notice that the left bar will at times extend below their view, since IE doesn't like to actually recognize that a <code>position: absolute</code> component actually exists within its parent, hence the * problem as well.</p>
