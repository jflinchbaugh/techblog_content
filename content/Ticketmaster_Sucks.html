<p>Nice, I saw this at the bottom of an unwelcome email:
<i>As a Ticketmaster user, you agree that Ticketmaster may contact you by email or
other means and use and disclose the information you submit, as described in
the Ticketmaster Privacy Policy.</i></p>
<p>Here, I thought they were just screwing me with their (in)convenience fees which amounted to about <b>20%</b> of the ticket price!  Now, they're selling my info to spammers and spamming me themselves.  I swear I unclicked the little box that suggested they send me crap, but I guess it didn't take.</p>
<p>If only events didn't end up exclusively Ticketmaster.  <a href = "http://www.cyberseats.com/">Cyberseats</a> has an AWESOME system where you can click the seat you want, instead of this "maybe we'll find you seats somewhere" crap.  <a href = "http://www.whitakercenter.org/home/">Whitaker Center's Sunoco Theater</a> uses this technology along with others.</p>
