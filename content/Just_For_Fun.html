<p>I recently read the Linus Torvalds sort-of biography, <a href = "http://www.harpercollins.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0066620732"><em>Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary</em></a>.  I think I set a personal reading speed record having read it in 5 days.</p>
<p>The book is getting a bit old (published in 2001, I believe), but the best parts are written about Linus' childhood and first computers.  Many of the observations were familiar from my childhood, so I often laughed aloud as I read the book.  He had the bug much worse than even I did, though, so he obviously took it much further.</p>
<p>I think most my computer friends will enjoy reading it.  Let me know if you'd like to borrow it.</p>
<p>Clicking around Amazon, I see <a href = "http://www.revolution-os.com/"><em>Revolution OS</em></a>, a documentary about the rise of Linux and free software, is also available on DVD.  I may need to pick that up.  I have it on VHS, taped from Sundance Channel or IFC.  That's another great must-see video.  It has lots of great interviews with Linus, RMS, Eric S Raymond, Bruce Perens, and others.</p>
