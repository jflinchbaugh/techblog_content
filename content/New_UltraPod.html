<p>Months ago, I lost my <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery/Macro/IMG_5106">UltraPod I</a>, one of my favorite little photography gadgets.  No other mini tripod quite compared.</p>
<p>Ever since, I've been watching for a nice price on a replacement. I knew I had gotten a deal buying the weird little Eddie Bauer branded one at an outlet, so I kept that price in mind.  I never did find a better price, so I finally ran back out to that outlet (months later) to see if by chance they still had them.</p>
<p>They didn't have the clearance colors, but they had nice black ones for cheaper than I could find them anywhere else shipped, so I bought 2 this time.</p>
<p>If anyone's looking for the slickest little mini tripod $12 can buy, head out to the Eddie Bauer outlet at Tanger Outlets.</p>
<p>It's wide base, ball head, and velcro strap set it apart.  It's amazingly large enough to still hold my new DSLR, and being able to strap it to a stick turns it into a handy monopod with materials at hand.</p>
