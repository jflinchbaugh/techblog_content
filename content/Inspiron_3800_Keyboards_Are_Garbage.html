<p>I really don't think I compute too much, but I keep wearing out keyboards on my Inspiron 3800.  Luckily Ebay keeps me stocked in replacement parts.  I just dropped a 3rd replacement keyboard into the machine, and I expect this one to eventually wear like all the others.  The springs get loose and it starts double typing or not typing some keys.</p>
<p>Now that I have 2 defunct keyboards, I can take the less-used springs from the oldest and replace the worn ones on the other keyboard.  Maybe I'll be able to rebuild them into one working keyboard, and I'll avoid hitting Ebay a bit longer.</p>
