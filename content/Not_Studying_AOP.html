<p>I've dug up a few AOP links, and I've read about it repeatedly in weblogs, but I've just not found the motivation to really learn it.  I've had no need for it, and it seems that <a href = "http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000180.html">the rest of the world hasn't needed it much either.</a>  I have plenty of time to absorb it when I finally recognize its use beyond what I can do with simple proxies.</p>
