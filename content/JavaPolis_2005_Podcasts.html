<p>It seems that many talks from the recent <a href = "http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/Home">JavaPolis conference</a> are now available online.  I've downloaded a small pile, and will be listening for a day or so.  They have lots of big names in Java  talking about the latest technologies today, so it should be informative.  Check it out.</p>
