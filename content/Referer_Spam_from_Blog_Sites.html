<p>I guess in an attempt to get around referer blacklists, I've noticed a couple porn spammers creating blogspot.com accounts and posting referers from there.  I've been deleting them when I see them.  I've already coded a cute little action to allow me to do that, but I guess I'll have to get around to more sophisticated management, maybe a blacklist just to make my life slightly easier.</p>
<p>It's about time for me to get back to coding.  I've taken a bit of a hiatus as I've been reading Design Patterns.  I'm collecting lots of good ideas, and I think I'll be able to redesign some aspects of my blog in a much cleaner fashion.</p>
