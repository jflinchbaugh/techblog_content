<p>I'm apparently developing a new obsession with Serial Experiments Lain.  I somehow stumbled upon a tiny little phone-sized Lain background, so I have that on my phone, then I named my notebook "navi" (the navigational personal computers used in Lain).  Digging around for an interesting desktop background for the notebook, I found that the absolutely wonderful theme song is a song called <i>Duvet</i> by Boa.  That's good to know, because I wouldn't mind having that song.</p>
