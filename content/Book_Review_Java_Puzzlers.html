<p>I recently read <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/032133678X/002-0258672-8579272?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Java Puzzlers</a> by Joshua Bloch and Neal Gafter.  I borrowed it from a coworker for a bit of leisure reading.  I expected good things, since Bloch's <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Recent_Reading_Technical_and_Not">Effective Java</a> was excellent.</p>
<p>The Java content felt much more relevant and accessible than my very old printing of the C Puzzle Book.  The puzzles progressively got more complex, but few really exceeded a page of code in length.  A few puzzlers revolve around boring <em>punctuation</em> mistakes, some are misconceptions about library routines, and toward the end he's discussing more complex thread interactions.  In the beginning, I was fanatically thinking through the puzzle before reading the solution, but toward the end I just didn't care anymore and proceeded right to the solution.</p>
<p>Since all the code samples were relatively short, they looked disturbingly like something I could write and expect I'd know how it will behave.  Now I fear that I may actually have some of these puzzles represented in my own code!  I'll never trust myself again.  The section on arithmetic and common overflows haunts me the most -- the errors are just so silent.  I think I'm smart enough to be cautious of the more complex examples when encountered in the real world.</p>
<p>In the end, it's an entertaining book and a quick read, and there are lessons to be learned.</p>
