<p>I've had my Timex Helix WRKS watch for well over 2 years now.  It's an interesting watch.  I use it mostly for time, but my next most popular function is the altimeter.</p>

<p>I mostly watch the altimeter for drastic skews from what I know the altitude should be at work or home.  I can derive the weather from the change.  It's easier to remember 2 known altitudes and compare at a glance than to remember the previous barometer reading or to scroll back through the previously saved readings in the watch to establish a trend.  I still calibrate the altimeter 1000 ft high to avoid it getting stuck in <code>LO</code> if the air pressure spikes.</p>
<p>I use the compass and the timer on occassion, and the alarm tells me when to leave for work in the morning.</p>
<p>I think I may have seen a low-battery indicator blink on for a moment, so I may need to soon replace that.  Even with all the extra instrumentation, the battery's outlasted the first watch band.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the watch isn't as refined as it should be.  It provides lots of data, but lacks a convenient interface to it.  When the day comes to replace this watch, I think I'll try the High Gear Axis again.  (I don't actually see any reason to replace the Timex, yet though.)  I've read that my issues with the 2 High Gear watches I previously owned have been resolved in newer revisions.  The Axis has a great interface with graphs, a unique method to attempt to compensate for altitude drift, and just showed more data on the screen at a time.  The Timex watch shows you surprisingly little on any one screen.  I like the a good console mode which shows me everything it can at once, so I don't need to switch around so much.  The crown interface to the Timex makes switching through modes as easy as it could be, though.</p>
