<p><a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Whatever/p6220002_001">These tiny fish</a> among others have grown into big, huge fish in my <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Whatever/p6220006_001">16-gallon aquarium</a>, but now they are unfortunately stuggling.  A fungus has been going around the tank and slowly killing fish.  I had 6 feeder fish that grew to each be a couple inches long, but this fungus has reduced that number to 3 now, and none of the fish are looking good.</p>

<p>It's disappointing.  I worked on that tank a lot (a lot for goldfish, anyway), and it's not helping.  Everyone was always amazed how large the fish had grown, but my luck seems to be running low.</p>
<p>The remaining fish are in a five-gallon bucket at the moment, but not thriving it seems.  I had hoped to rebuild the tank from scratch over the weekend -- new water, gravel, live plants, plastic plants.  It's too little too late.  I guess I'll need to add new fish to that equation.  I'll probably get more feeder fish, since they're fun to watch grow.</p>
