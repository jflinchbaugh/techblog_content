Polarity is a cool little game
where 2 players face off
taking turns
placing all their disc magnets
on a canvas field
until they've placed them all.
Each magnet must _lean_
on the magnetic field
of other pieces that
the player has placed
on the playing field.
If a player disturbs
magnets that are already placed,
and they snap together,
then the player needs
to remove the pieces from the field
and return them to their hand.

The game fell out of pubilcation
and got hard to acquire,
so I was out of luck
when I wanted to stop borrowing
a friend's copy and have my own.

I had just printed the sleeve
for the puck-shaped Ruuvi Tag,
and that design would be pretty close
to a game piece with a disc magnet inserted.
I had already purchased magnets,
so I'll print a bunch of these pieces,
paint the circle on a piece of canvas,
and I'll have my game.

I'll likely make some variations
in the future,
such as rendering some pieces
as some polygons
instead of circles,
so you can have a limited number of them
that will be really good for tight situations.
