https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity\_(game)[Polarity]
is a game of placing magnetic discs
so that they lean
on the magnetic fields of others.
It went out of print
a while ago,
so I wanted to make
a scaled-down version
of my own
with some 3D-printed pieces.
I left out some aspects
of the original game.

The rules had always been a bit confusing,
so I'll try to distill a set of my own rules here.

.Objective
* Be the first to play all discs in your supply.
* Collect the most discs in towers, stacks of discs.

.Setup
* Roll out the playing mat flat
  on a stable surface.
* Give each player half the discs for their supply:
  19 to each player.
* Players take turns placing
  foundation discs flat
  on the mat,
  touching no others,
  until each player has placed 4 foundations.

.Game Play
* Take turns leaning discs from your supply
  on magnetic fields of your discs on the mat.
* Play only on the mat.
* Play only on your own discs
  with your color facing up,
  not on your opponent's discs.
* A turn ends
  by successfully placing a disc
  or by causing a fault.
* Play ends immediately upon causing a fault,
  so pieces still in the hand
  are returned to the player's supply.
* Faults occur 4 ways:
** A leaning disc falls flat.
** 2 or more discs touch each other.
** Moving a tower or foundation disc
  more than its diameter.
** Knocking a disc off the mat.
* A player can intentionally cause a fault
  to convert a leaning disc into a new foundation.
** A player can only convert their own discs.
** The fault still ends their turn.
* Faults are resolved by:
** If discs snap to the disc being placed
  while still in the hand,
  the player removes the touching discs
  and returns them to their supply.
** If discs on the board are touching,
  the opponent carefully retrieves the discs
  allowing them to snap the rest
  of the way to form a tower,
  and places it anywhere on the mat.
** While retrieving or placing a tower,
  the tower is treated like a disc being placed,
  so causing a fault should be resolved the same way
  as when placing a piece.
** If a disc just fell, but stayed the same color (a conversion),
  it stays where it is, but the turn ends.
** If a fault flips one disc from one color to the other,
  without otherwise touching other discs,
  the opponent can choose to retrieve the disc
  and place it anywhere on the mat.
* A player is responsible for any faults after a move
  until the opponents hand approaches the mat.

.End of Game
* The game ends when one player depletes
  their supply.
* A player no longer has any discs
  with their color showing
  left on the board.

.Scoring
* Each disc in a tower is worth +1 point.
* Each disc in the supply is worth -1 point.
