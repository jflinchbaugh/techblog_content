https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity\_(game)[Polarity]
is a game of placing magnetic discs
so that they lean
on the magnetic fields of others.
It went out of print
a while ago,
so I wanted to make
a scaled-down version
of my own
with some 3D-printed pieces.
I left out some aspects
of the original game.

The rules had always been a bit confusing,
so I'll try to distill a set of my own rules here.

.Objective
* Be the first to play all discs in your supply.
* Collect the most discs in towers.

.Setup
* Roll out the playing mat flat
  on a stable surface.
* Give each player half the discs for their supply:
  19 to each player.
* Players take turns placing
  foundation discs flat
  on the mat,
  touching no others,
  until each player has placed 4 foundations.

.Game Play
* Take turns leaning discs from your supply
  on magnetic fields of your discs on the mat.
* Play only on the mat.
* Play only on your own discs
  with your color facing up,
  not on your opponent's discs.
* A turn ends by successfully placing a disc or by causing a fault.
* Faults occur 2 ways:
** A leaning disc falls flat.
** 2 or more discs touch each other.
* If a fault involves the disc being placed,
  the player removes the fallen or touching discs
  and returns them to their supply.
* If a fault doesn't involve the disc being played,
  the opponent retrieves the tower,
  and places it anywhere on the mat.
* While retrieving or placing the tower,
  the tower is treated like a disc being placed,
  so causing a fault should be resolved the same way
  as when placing a piece.
* A player can intentionally cause a fault
  to make new foundations,
  but only by acting on their own discs,
  and the fault still ends their turn.

.Scoring
* The game ends when one player depletes
  their supply.
* Each disc in a tower is worth +1 point.
* Each disc in the supply is worth -1 point.
