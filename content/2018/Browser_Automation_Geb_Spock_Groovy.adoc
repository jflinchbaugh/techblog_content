I recently gave a talk
and demonstration,
https://jflinchbaugh.github.io/geb-preso/[
    Browser Automation with Geb, Spock, and Groovy],
at the
https://www.meetup.com/CapitalAreaSoftwareEngineers/events/txfzgqyxnblb/[
    Capital Area Software Engineers]
group in Harrisburg, PA.
While explaining the whole stack of software,
I showed how to:

* Start a project in Gradle
* Get the Geb and Webdriver dependencies in place
* Get started in Spock testing framework
* Start up a browser for testing
* Interact with the page content
* Wait for asynchronous content
* Abstract away page components into Geb Page classes

The slides and all the code are available in my
https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/geb-preso[geb-preso] repo.
It includes copies of the code I had prepared,
the code we wrote live as a group,
and my little toy

JS app I was testing.
