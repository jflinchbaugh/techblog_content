I was seeing the new GIMP 2.10.0
doing bad things
with multiple gradients
on a transparentl layer
so I logged
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=795866[Bug 795866].
They quickly fixed the bug
within 48 hours,
but now I'm sitting here
reloading the https://www.gimp.org/news/[GIMP news] page
to see if they've cut the newest release.
