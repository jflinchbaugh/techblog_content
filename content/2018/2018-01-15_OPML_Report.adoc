I got some much-needed help from the
https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Clojure/[Vancouver Clojure Meetup]
on a remote Clojure(Script) hack night.
They helped me clean up my code a bit,
and they pointed out some next steps,
like a generic method for accessing
nodes in the XML.
I really appreciate the help,
since I don't even know
how good Clojure code looks.
