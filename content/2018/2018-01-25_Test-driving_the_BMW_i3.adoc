I've let a few friends
drive my electric i3
from BMW,
and I would generally let anyone
give it a try,
because it's just so much fun.

Here are the most amusing features to test:

* Electric torque:
  Kick it into _Comfort_ Mode and floor it!
* One-foot driving:
  The car will immediately start regenerating
  power to nearly bring the car to a stop
  when you lift your foot off the accelerator.
* Adaptive Cruise Control:
  Engage the cruise control in traffic
  and watch it maintain a distance
  from the car in front of you.
  It'll even bring the car to a stop automatically
  as traffic stops.
  (It takes a little practice to trust it.)
* Self-parking:
  I admit this is a trick
  that I don't often use
  in practice,
  but it's exciting and scary
  to show off.
* Check out the cool eDrive displays:
  It shows energy flow, consumption graphs, etc.
* It's oh so quiet:
  Drive down a quiet street
  with the windows down.
* Check out the plug:
  it can do J1772 and CCS/DC.
* There's no engine in the front!
* BMW Connected app:
  It offers remote controls,
  including heating or cooling.
* Storage and accessories:
  there are nice modular ports
  for cup holders and 3D-printed accessories
  and nice elastic straps in the back
  which make it easy to stow gear.
