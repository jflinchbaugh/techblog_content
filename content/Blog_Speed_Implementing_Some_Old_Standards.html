<p>I had overlooked a few standard optimizations which I should have included from the beginning:
<ol>
<li><strong>Cache Homes</strong> -- This included telling the xdoclet-generated utility classes to cache homes they lookup and to explicitly code my ejbCreate() to cache homes of my entities in the session facade.</li>
<li><strong>Use DAO to bypass EJB finders when analyzing large lists</strong> -- Getting the latest comment.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>I have to say, it feels pretty fast again -- I'll have to go screwing it up again real soon.</p>
