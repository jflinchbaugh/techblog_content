<p>I've put together a <a href = "http://del.icio.us/jflinchbaugh/NewComputer">shopping list</a> for the new server.  I think it's conservative, but should serve my purposes for years.  In addition to the stuff on my list, I have an old Adaptec U160/Fast SCSI card on the way.  I'll be reusing the old case, SCSI drives, a NIC, and the DVD drive.  That should about do it.  Now I just need to convince myself to spend the money.  I thank Erik for helping bring me up to speed on today's tech and helping me spec what should be a very solid machine (because I never want to build another computer).</p>
<p>It'll mostly be a firewall, remote Gnome desktop, print server, Gallery server, video editing workstation, file server, and maybe my beta Java application server.  I think I'll leave most my real services running out at the VPS.</p>
<p><strong>Update (3 May 2006):</strong>
Well, the new server pieces are ordered along with an Acer Sempron 3100 workstation for the <a href = "http://www.k-prep.com/">K-Prep Learning Center</a> office.</p>
<p>I had hoped to test the Adaptec 19160 SCSI card tonight in the old Pentium 200 which I'm currently using as a firewall, but it's taking forever and a day to build a new kernel with support for the card.  Migrating the old server install from i386 to amd64 should be interesting.  I'm still not sure how I'm going to do that.  I fear it may take a reinstall.  Fortunately, I don't need to hurry with it.</p>
