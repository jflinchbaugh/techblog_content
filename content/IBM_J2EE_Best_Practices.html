<p>IBM has a list of <a href = "http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0405_brown/0405_brown.html?ca=dgr-lnxw02J2EEtop12">J2EE Best Practices</a>, and I agree with the whole thing at every point, though I must admit that I haven't followed it strictly.  I haven't been using unit tests or J2EE container security on recent projects.</p>

<p>Point #5, <i>Build what you know</i> is my number one tip right now given my current work environment.   Some people are trying to design an entire subsystem based on several complex structures of queues and message-driven beans when we've never even seen <strong>one</strong> in action.  We have a good bit to learn here, and we should really do this in a few iterations and evolve it as necessary.</p>
