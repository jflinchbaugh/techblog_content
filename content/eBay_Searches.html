<p>Some people's websites show you what song they currently have playing, but I haven't actually coded that bit yet.  Instead, I'm publishing a little list of my recent eBay searches in my tree of links on the sidebar.  That probably gives you a better insight into my psyche than my music selections anyway.</p>
<p>They're manually added, so don't hope to catch my searches for "<em>manual to overthrow government</em>", "<em>political revolution for dummies</em>", or any of that.  Sorry.</p>
