<p>On rare occassion, I'll see a referer from livexxxcams.com or whatever.  I couldn't really do much about it, since the referer list is only stored in the running servlet context, and I couldn't really manipulate it behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I've added a quick little action (DeleteReferer) which allows me to kill any referer I like while I'm logged into my blog.</p>
<p>I've avoided comment spam just by having a unique code base which doesn't function like Movable Type or other common packages.</p>
