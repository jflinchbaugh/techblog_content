<p>I've been tracking my blog code in subversion for over a month now, and it's gone pretty smoothly.  I can do pretty much anything I need.  I tag releases by copying them to the blog/tags folder.  I copied the trunk to a branch to develop the new data-driven link system and merged code back and forth several times.  Merging seems to work like magic compared to CVS.  I think I'm really able to think in SVN now.</p>
