The
http://www.pbs.org/transistor/background1/events/tradio.html[First Transistor Radio]
hit the market on this day (18 October) in 1954.
(Read that in the voice of Garrison Keillor.)

Learning this today reminded me
of one of my first pieces
of electronics as a kid.

It was a little blue, portable _transistor_ AM radio
that took 2 AA batteries.
I got it as a prize
from the school fundraiser,
and I specifically remember it being listed
as a _transistor_ radio,
like that was something special.
I'm not sure how special that really was in around 1985,
since we'd evidently had the technology readily available
since 1954.

That radio was *packed* full of components on a board
in its blue plastic shell.
From the first time I had to open it to put batteries in it,
I was intrigued by it --
solder joints, variable capacitor, capacitors, resistors,
transistors, antenna coil with ferrous core,
bits of glue holding it together, etc.

That thing came apart many times as I compared
its contents to other devices and to those
on my electronics kit later.
