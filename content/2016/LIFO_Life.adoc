.Information Overload
I've heard lots of talk recently about
http://www.wnyc.org/story/case-infomagical/[information overload].
I even tried to do that whole Infomagical Challenge,
and I couldn't really convince myself it was necessary.
I just don't seem to have that addiction trait.

.Social
Our social feeds are in reverse chronological order -- 
dip in, see the latest, scroll a little to see something older,
and then move on. 
Sure I'll hit reload a couple times 
when I'm bored to see something new,
(but I could totally stop whenever I want).
I don't feel like I need to necessarily click the bait
or read everything.

.Photo Workflow
The reverse-chronological (or LIFO, last-in-first-out) order
works great for my photo workflow too.
When I was working chronologically, 
*every* photo ended up late -- up to a month or 2 at times.
Working from the newest stuff back fixed that.
The latest party or event could often
get posted, while some lower-priority sets of photos
could wait a little.  When I got super-busy, 
*some* photos could end up a month or 2 delayed, 
but not *all* of them.

.Culling in Reverse
LIFO even saves me time when I'm culling photos,
which is the *first* thing I do after importing photos.
We often work a scene and shoot until we're convinced
that we have the shot we want,
so I start looking for the keepers from the *end*
of the set and browse my way back 
to the *beginning* of the set.
When I know I have the keeper,
I can more confidently skip all the previous images
that led me to the keeper.
There was no point in studying
those earlier half-baked images
when I'll keep finding better versions
as I work forward.

.Delete Most the Photos
Once I've picked that 10% I'm keeping, 
I delete everything else, 
because I still have the end in mind 
-- reasonably backing up all my images.
Some probably find that idea backward too.
