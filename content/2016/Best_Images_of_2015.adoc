I've taken a few hard moments
and collected my favorite 10 images 
from all of 2015.  
My first pass yielded 101 images,
and I pared it down from there
over a couple hours.

== The Orb at Ardmore

The Orb, 
the legendary ambient musicians, 
put on an amazing show
near Philadelphia this year.
I had my one speedlight as usual,
and I happened to have tucked it 
into a stack of chairs behind a curtain on stage right.
Right before The Orb took the stage,
a publicist or someone came
and asked that I limit my photographs
to the first couple songs.
I thought, "No problem."
I knew I already had a light perfectly placed
and ready to go, since I had freely shot
the opening act.

== DJ Uranko at Tellus 360

I was out to Tellus to see friends
and they had a guest DJ,
so I had some fun shooting as always.
I like how excited and surprised people
are to see images after an event like this.
I spiced up the image a little
by providing the crowd view on the projector screen
to fill some space in the image.
They really should project the crowd up there.

== The Roar

My friends at Shadowland keep the dance floor intense,
and they always seem to appreciate seeing photos from the nights.

== Playing with Fire in God's Basement

This year, I got brave and ventured out again 
to longer nights, 
like Big Dub out in the woods
and God's Basement Reunion outside Philadelphia.
It was the first party in a newly reclaimed warehouse
now called _The Arts Garage: Waterfront_.

== Neon Kaleidscope

The Neon Kaleidoscope (previously Pure) crew 
celebrated 5 years in 2015.
I had just seen an exhibition
of Richard Avadon's "Family Affair" series,
so I knew I wanted to do a similar
stitching to make a wide image to capture
everyone at one of Neon Kaleidoscope's biggest nights.

== DJ Diesel

Jay and I have been splashing light
around the Lizard Lounge for quite some time now.

== Knobs and Switches

I've started working to photograph
the gear and other environmental stuff
from raves. I love the gesture in this image.

== Nell at Lizard Lounge

I shot many of my favorite images
at Lizard Lounge this year.
This image resulted from a quick
collaboration with Nell Doll
on a Neon Kaleidoscope night.
This is when I started
really carrying more gear
into clubs.

== Inside and Out
image::{content_rootpath}images/2015/duplicity.jpg[]
I had the great opportunity to shoot with Marsha Denill
in the same house with Brooke Shaden!
The inspiration was strong this day,
since I knew others would be making amazing images.

== Fiesta
image::{content_rootpath}images/2015/fiesta.jpg[]
I love photographing toys,
and my bright green Ford Fiesta 
is my favorite car I've had, 
so it only makes sense for me 
to have a tiny replica of the car.
I had wanted to shoot this image for a couple years.
