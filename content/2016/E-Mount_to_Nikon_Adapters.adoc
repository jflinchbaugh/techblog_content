.Switch to Sony
When I bought my first Sony a6000 body
in September 2014,
I needed an adapter
to get started
and to mount my Nikon AI-S and G lenses
on the new camera body,
since I had no intention to buy new lenses.
I knew to use one of these manual adapters
I'd need to turn the lens open,
focus,
and then stop back down to shoot.

.Metabones Adapter
The adapter was an important part of kit
that was going to make the whole switch possible,
so I had settled on spending the extra money
and getting the
http://amzn.to/2itzBMp[Metabones Adapter].

* Cost: about $140 at the time.
* Physically sets the aperture on my Nikon G lenses.
* Long-throwing aperture ring for fine control,
  about 50 degrees
  from wide-open to fully stopped down.
* Marked for 8 stops (F to 7).
* Moves smoothly with no clicking at individual stops.
  This is apparently a feature for shooting video.
* Convenient tripod mount
  which is nice for balance and larger tripod plates.
* Made completely of metal.
* Solid connection to camera and lens.
* Only required
  a little screw-tightening
  on the Nikon side
  in 2 years
  of service.

The Metabones adapter has served me well
over the past couple of years,
but when talking to people about my switch,
I got curious how this adapter compared
to less expensive adapters.

.K&F Concepts Adapter
In July 2016,
I purchased the http://amzn.to/2iQoRV0[K&F Concepts Adapter]
to compare to the Metabones that I definitely liked.
I used it for a couple months almost exclusively
and found it to feel solid
and to work fine
with only a bit of adjustment
in my expectations
of the distance to turn the ring.

* Cost: about $20.
* Physically sets the aperture on my Nikon G lenses.
* Aperture ring throws a very short distance,
  about 20 degrees
  from wide-open to fully stopped down.
* No marks for the stops.
* Clicking at each stop,
  so it's basically impossible
  to set part stops.
  (This is OK, though,
  since I like to think in full stops anyway.)
* No tripod mount,
  but my larger lenses
  have their own tripod collars.
  (For a short lens,
  sometimes I like to switch back to the Metabones
  for its tripod mount.)
* Made completely of metal.
* Solid connection to camera and lens.
* No service or modifications needed yet.

In the end,
The K&F adapter
surprised me
with its build quality,
and it feels good to use.
I was surprised to find the short
throw wasn't an issue for my shooting,
but I do miss the tripod mount
on occasion.
It's always good
to have some backup gear,
and switching between these 2
was easy.

For the money,
I'd have no trouble recommending
the K&F or something similar
to purchase first,
and upgrade to the Metabones
only if you find
that you need the extra features.
