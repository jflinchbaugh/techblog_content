JBake 2.5.0 got support for the MarkupTemplateEngine,
so I wanted to give it a try, since structured code will be nicer
than extreme scriptlet stuff that was happening in the original Groovy
template example.
The https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-example-project-groovy-mte[stock MTE example]
shows off MTE templates, but it also switched to
http://foundation.zurb.com/[Foundation]
in place of
http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap].

I've been looking forward to really learning Bootstrap
for work and my personal projects,
so I'm not looking to switch frameworks right now,
so I rebuilt my own
https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/jbake-example-project-groovy-mte-bootstrap[example project with MTE and Bootstrap]
based on the original Groovy/Bootstrap sample I had previously used.

Hopefully, I'll get a little feedback and the JBake people will
incorporate my contribution.
