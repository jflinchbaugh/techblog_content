The kids got a little
https://printm3d.com/themicro/[M3D Micro]
for Christmas,
and so started our adventures into 3D printing.

I intended to let the kids
learn the whole thing from scratch,
but I knew I was throwing them
a little bit of a curve ball
by only having Linux netbooks
to drive it,
so I ended up getting a headstart
