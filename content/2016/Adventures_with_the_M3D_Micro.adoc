The kids got a little
https://printm3d.com/themicro/[M3D Micro]
for Christmas,
and so started our adventures into 3D printing.

I intended to let the kids
learn the whole thing from scratch,
but I knew I was throwing them
a little bit of a curve ball
by only having Linux netbooks
to drive it,
so I ended up getting a headstart
setting up
http://octoprint.org/[OctoPrint]
and the
https://github.com/donovan6000/M3D-Fio[M3D-Fio] driver.

At the end of December 2015
when I was starting,
the M3D-Fio driver
had some configurations
in the repository
that might not have been optimal,
so I was fighting a bit
with a few problems:

* adhesion to the bed
* gaps and lines in the bottom layers
* stringing
* speed
* other quality issues

I thrashed around for quite some time
changing settings I didn't really understand
and Matthew spent a night helping me
and showing me what his much larger printer
could do -- that helped immensely,
since it gave me some hints
as to what I should be expecting from my printer.
I also learned what the different settings
should be doing for me.

For an entire Sunday,
about 18 hours,
I printed 1cm test cubes
and experimented with settings.
I quickly decided
I should have my settings and profiles
tracked in my own local git repository
so I can always rollback
to previous settings.

After a week or so,
some updates
from the M3D-Fio repository
brought us more success
with more default settings
that matched the defaults
found in the original software
from Micro.
The conservative settings also added rafts
and slowed down the print a bit.
