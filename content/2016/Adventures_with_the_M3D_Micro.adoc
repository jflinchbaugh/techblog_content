The kids got a little
https://printm3d.com/themicro/[M3D Micro]
for Christmas,
and so started our adventures into 3D printing.

I intended to let the kids
learn the whole thing from scratch,
but I knew I was throwing them
a little bit of a curve ball
by only having Linux netbooks
to drive it,
so I ended up getting a headstart
setting up
http://octoprint.org/[OctoPrint]
and the
https://github.com/donovan6000/M3D-Fio[M3D-Fio] driver.

At the end of December 2015
when I was starting,
the M3D-Fio driver
had some configurations
in the repository
that might not have been optimal,
so I was fighting a bit
with a few problems:

* adhesion to the bed
* gaps and lines in the bottom layers
* stringing
* speed
* other quality issues

I thrashed around for quite some time
changing settings I didn't really understand
and Matthew spent a night helping me
and showing me what his much larger printer
could do -- that helped immensely,
since it gave me some hints
as to what I should be expecting from my printer.
I also learned what the different settings
should be doing for me.

For an entire Sunday,
about 18 hours,
I printed 1cm test cubes
and experimented with settings.
I quickly decided
I should have my settings and profiles
tracked in my own local git repository
so I can always rollback
to previous settings.

After a week or so,
some updates
from the M3D-Fio repository
brought us more success
with more default settings
that matched the defaults
found in the original software
from Micro.
The conservative settings also added rafts
and slowed down the print a bit.

Now I only needed 
to copy the default PLA 0.25mm slicing profile 
and make a few changes:

* bump wall thickness from 0.35 to 0.70 (multiples of 0.35, since
  that's the nozzle thickness
* switch the platform adhesion to "none" instead of "raft"
* enable a 150mm skirt to ensure the plastic is flowing

I ultimately found 
that I needed to compensate 
the bed height by -0.4mm
to get more of a "squish" on the first layer
to get it to stick to the bed adequately.
With that offset, 
the automatic calibration 
seemed to do its job better 
and keep the prints starting out alright.

Other mistakes and problems I've observed:

* Sometimes the Z axis (distance from bed)
  got reversed and the printer would drag the head harder
  on the bed instead of working its way away from the bed
  to make room for the print.  I'm not sure what caused it.
* A y-backlash of -0.50mm helped close a little gap 
  between the infill and the circular shell 
  when printing a cylinder.  
  That can be calibrated 
  with the M3D's backlash calibration test in OctoPrint.
* Setting a backlash speed in the M3D preferences 
  caused the head to pause at the end of every infill line
  and in the middle of drawing circle shells.  
  While paused, the plastic would still oose and pile up
  terribly.
