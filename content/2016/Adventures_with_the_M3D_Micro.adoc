The kids got a little
https://printm3d.com/themicro/[M3D Micro]
for Christmas,
and so started our adventures into 3D printing.

I intended to let the kids
learn the whole thing from scratch,
but I knew I was throwing them
a little bit of a curve ball
by only having Linux netbooks
to drive it,
so I ended up getting a headstart
setting up
http://octoprint.org/[OctoPrint]
and the
https://github.com/donovan6000/M3D-Fio[M3D-Fio] driver.

At the end of December 2015
when I was starting,
the M3D-Fio driver
had some configurations
in the repository
that might not have been optimal,
so I was fighting a bit
with a few problems:

* adhesion to the bed
* gaps and lines in the bottom layers
* stringing
* speed
* other quality issues

I thrashed around for quite some time
changing settings I didn't really understand,
and Matthew spent a night helping me
and showing me what his much larger printer
could do -- that helped immensely,
since it gave me some hints
as to what I should be expecting from my printer.
I also learned what the different settings
should be doing for me.

For an entire Sunday,
about 18 hours,
I printed 1cm test cubes
and experimented with settings.
I quickly decided
I should have my settings and profiles
tracked in my own local git repository,
so I can always rollback
to previous settings.

After a week or so,
some updates
from the M3D-Fio repository
brought us more success
with more default settings
that matched the defaults
found in the original software
from Micro.
The conservative settings also added rafts
and slowed down the print a bit.

I was able to take those conservative settings
and speed them up a bit and remove the rafts --
the BuildTak holds a print pretty well
even without the raft.
I based my customizations on the stock profile
that prints at 0.25mm layer thickness
to get even more speed
out of the printer.

I also found keeping a -0.4mm
bed offset on my printer helped get
just enough squish in the first layer
to help get a more solid bottom layre
and good adhesion to the bed.

Another notable configuration tip I had picked up was
to set the wall thickness to a multiple
of the nozzle size.  
In the case of the M3D,
the nozzle thickness is 0.35mm,
so I'm using a thickness of 0.70mm.
Before I had learned that, 
a couple 
of my initial http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1172630[chachkies]
came out with thin gaps where the slicer should
have decided to fill.

I'm at the point now
that I have pretty reasonable expectations
for what the printer can do,
and I can start up the machine
after a week or 2 of sitting,
and run a print through reliably
without needing to make adjustments.
That's great for letting the kids
just make whatever they want.
Both kids have been able to get
into Tinkercad and produce some printable designs.
Ben's doing Nerf rail accessories,
and Marie is designing a new cap
for my growler.

Finally, I've pushed my configurations
to a
https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/m3d_config.git[public git repository]
to serve as reference
for anyone else who cares.
