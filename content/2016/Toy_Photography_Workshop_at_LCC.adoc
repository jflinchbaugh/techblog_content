== Why Shoot in Small Studio
I started out like most people:
photographing family moments and travel.
Then I wanted to practice
without needing the people to cooperate,
so I shot some landscape.
When I wanted to continue to practice
even when people weren't around,
and it was dark outside,
I switched to practicing lighting
with small objects (toys)
after everyone else has gone to bed.

Photography in these small studios
allows you to practice many aspects
of photography including:
* storytelling
* lighting
* composition
