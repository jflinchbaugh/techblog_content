<p>Somehow, I managed to do most my modern technical reading out of order.  I started reading <em>Core J2EE Patterns</em> and other J2EE books, then I dropped I went back to fill in the blanks with GoF Patterns.  Stepping back to even simpler concepts, I recently read Fowler's <em>Refactoring</em>, and I've finally discovered and read Bloch's <em>Effective Java</em>.  I fortunately got to borrow it from a coworker.</p>
<p>I found reinforcement for many of my current good practices (which is nice when you're in a training/architecture-type position).  I also picked up some tips which I knew needed attention, but just never quite found, such as properly dealing with synchronization or serialization.</p>
<p>Concurrently, I had been reading William Gibson's <em>Pattern Recognition</em>.  Quite unlike all his previous books, this one has only 1 storyline instead of 3.  This made it feel like a much quicker read, and I managed to put it down and pick it up often without confusion.  It was one of the more satisfying of his books set in the present or very near future.</p>
<p>To hold my attention for a couple weeks, I just picked up a relatively cheap book about digital photo retouching called <em>40 Digital Photo Retouching Techniques</em>.  It's based on Photoshop Elements, but it seems to have lots of good ideas, and most of it seems to translate to Gimp easily for me.</p>
<p>After that, I'll probably borrow <em>Java Puzzlers</em> from the same guy who lent me <em>Effective Java</em> -- He has quite the library.</p>
