<p>I've recently read that <a href = "http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2007/02/014999.htm">Bank of America will be offering mobile banking</a> soon.  I've had WAP access to my banking for years from <a href = "http://www.psecu.com/account_access/pocket_teller/">PSECU</a>.   It's great to see someone doing something so innovative so early.</p> 
<p>Now I guess I may get access to my credit cards soon.</p>
