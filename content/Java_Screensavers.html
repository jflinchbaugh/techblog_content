<p>Neat!  We can now easily <a href = "http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/saverbeans.html">write screensavers in Java</a> with this new little opensource package from Sun.</p>
<p>The desktop will be ours finally!  After all those years of trying to crack the desktop market, Java will finally do it through screensavers -- "Write once, waste cpu anywhere."</p>
<p>I must admit, it is sort of curious, and will most likely be fun to see.</p>
