<p><a href = "http://www.brunningonline.net/simon/blog/">Simon Brunning</a> has collected links to <a href = "http://www.brunningonline.net/simon/blog/archives/001274.html">JSTL Info</a>.  I'll try to actually read through these when time permits.</p>
<p>The first quick reference is a whopping 13-pages alone!  That leads me to believe I've not even begun to really use this thing.</p>
