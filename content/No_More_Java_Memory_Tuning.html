<p>My days of tuning my JBoss server for a slim server environment seem to be over!  <a href = "http://rimuhosting.com/">RimuHosting</a> beefed up their <a href = "http://rimuhosting.com/order/startorder1.jsp?type=18">standard VPS plans</a> to include lots more RAM.  RAM on my plan basically doubled!</p>
<p>I rebooted my box (just short of an uptime record), and then removed many of the constraints on my JBoss server configs.  The next JBoss server install is going to be much easier, since I'll not have to tune so much.</p>
