<p>I stumbled upon an interesting little read about <a href = "http://www.si.edu/lemelson/Quartz/index.html">Quartz Watches</a> and how they took over the world.  There's even mention of Hamilton of Lancaster, PA producing the <a href = "http://www.si.edu/lemelson/Quartz/coolwatches/hamilton.html">first battery-powered watch</a> to start the movement toward today's 87% penetration of digital watches into the watch market.</p>
