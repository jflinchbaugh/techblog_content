<p>IBM has a <a href = "http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-santa1/index.html?ca=drs-j5103">series of articles</a> leading the reader through the creation of a Secret Santa application using all the J2EE bells and whistles from entity beans to jakarta-struts.  It sounds like a monument to overengineering that I thought only I cared to code, especially considering my blog is implemented much the same way.  It looks like a great educational piece though, and I look forward to studying it thoroughly.  It's even geared towards JBoss with the appropriate xdoclet tags.  It seems very odd that it doesn't include the configs for Websphere, being this an IBM article and all.</p>
<p>Maybe we can replace the Java Pet Store with this one: Java Toy Store!</p>
