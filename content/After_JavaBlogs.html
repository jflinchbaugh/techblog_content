<p>Now that I have topic-based RSS feeds and I could publish to java.blogs, it feels like I'm done coding for the blog -- time to just burn out for a while.</p>
<p>I'm almost wrong, though.  I have plenty that could still be done:
<ul>
<li>Clean out old finders now that I've switched to an <code>ArticleRequest</code> search object to encapsulate all the filtering parameters.</li>
<li>Implement a DAO method to select articles by <code>ArticleRequest</code>, instead of filtering it through Java code.</li>
<li>Preview comments before posting.  Selectable HTML formatting for comments.</li>
<li>Spellchecking.</li>
<li>User/password management.</li>
<li>Multiple-author support.  I eliminated most the code that supported having more than one login, since it complicated the entire system before I clarified some things.</li>
<li>Trackback/Ping.</li>
<li>Data-driven links.</li>
<li>Smarter login behavior for remembering your location, instead of always sending you back to the article list page.</li>
<li>Topic management.</li>
<li>Apply struts validation where possible.</li>
</ul>
I basically want to start making the whole system more generic so it may be suitable for public release and re-use someday.</p>
