<p>I've created a <a href = "http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> account, <a href = "http://del.icio.us/jflinchbaugh">del.icio.us/jflinchbaugh</a>.  The whole idea of social bookmarking seems interesting, though I'm not sure yet how I'm going to use it.  It's tempting to use it as my list of links to read in the near future.  The bookmarklet thing makes it convenient to use as well.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I'll probably end up studying it and implementing the bookmarking techniques into my weblog code to facilitate tracking my own "to read" list without necessarily needing to post a weblog article like I have in the past.</p>
<p>They have RSS feeds for your bookmark list, so it's easy to integrate your del.icio.us links back into Firefox' bookmarks by subscribing to the RSS.  I could also integrate the RSS of my del.icio.us links into my weblog to pull the links from there and include them here.</p>
