<p>I've been surprised over the past couple days to note that I've been seeing Linux machines out in the wild, including <a href = "http://www.lowes.com/">Lowes</a> and <a href = "http://www.pearlevision.com/">Pearle Vision</a>.  The screens caught my eye, because they were oddly X-looking.  Additionally, I saw an XScreensaver locking a terminal at Pearle.</p>
<p>While Pearle's system looked similar, it seems that Lowes is running a system from <a href = "http://www.ultimatetechnology.com/technology/linux.php4">Ultimate Technology</a>.</p>
