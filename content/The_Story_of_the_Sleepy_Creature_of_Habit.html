<p>The sleepy creature of habit commutes an hour to work every morning.  Upon arriving at his destination, he knows every day that the outer 2 lanes are blessed for safe passage if one carries the mystical, magical white key called the EZ-Pass.</p>
<p>Of course, sensing his familiarity, the Gods of the PTC like to remake the reality which was commonly known and moves or eliminates whole EZ-Pass lanes.  The sleepy creature of habit is again duped into parting with his King's Ransom ($8.50 when coming from the land where the sun rises).  Curses on the PTC!</p>
