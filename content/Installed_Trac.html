<p>The new edition of <a href = "http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10203">Practical Subversion</a> mentioned <a href = "http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> as a simple issue tracking software that integrated nicely with <a href = "http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>.  Fortunately, Debian has it already packaged up, so I installed it, read a little, and setup a few Trac repositories to match my Subversion projects.</p>
<p>I just used the default <a href = "http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> support, and I was on my way pretty quickly.  It gives me a wiki, issue tracker, and time-line, and source viewer -- all of which interlinked for easy navigation.  Now that it's working, I may go to the trouble to convert the DB over to my preexisting PostgreSQL install.</p>
<p>After having read <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Practices_of_an_Agile_Developer">Practices of an Agile Developer</a>, I started to realize that I could use a few extra tools to help me organize my personal projects and keep on track.  Wikis have also seemed like an intriguing technology, but I always have doubts about my own ability to keep it in order and be able to find things when I need them.  It must be better than the knowledge just floating around in my head only though.  (That feels like a real problem at work.)</p>
