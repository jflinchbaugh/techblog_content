<p>Tom DeLay will go on trial for a huge money laundering and campaign finance scandals related to Jack Abramoff, but he's still <a href = "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/08/AR2006030800288.html">the best Republican that Texas can dig up</a>.  Nice.</p>
<p>In other news, our beloved Senator Santorum <a href = "http://www.macon.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/pennsylvania/counties/montgomery_county/14042885.htm?source=rss&amp;channel=inquirer_montgomery_county">wrote the foreword</a> for a book celebrating Phillip Johnson, the law professor (not a scientist?) considered to be the founder of Intelligent Design.</p>
