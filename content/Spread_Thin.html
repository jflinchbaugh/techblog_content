<p>Looking at my weblog, I feel that I've spread the content that I produce pretty thinly.  Jaiku sucks up most my little thoughts, Flickr sucks up my occassional notable photo, del.icio.us has my links -- I don't have much left to actually post to this weblog.  Fortunately Jaiku aggregates it all together, otherwise, you'd never be able to find it all.</p>
<p>I'll have to try to remember to dig through my past Jaiku posts for ideas to expand into real articles.</p>
