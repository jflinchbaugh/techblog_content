This <a href = "http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=440">comic</a>
over at megatokyo had me rolling (as much as is acceptable at my workplace) in the  aisles.  For anyone trying to follow the story (of which this is a minimal part I  think), I'm still kind of confused, but recent strips have made Largo's weird fantasy world a bit more understandable.

The only bad thing is that it's taken me until now to get around to reading comics.  This is supposed to be my morning activity.
