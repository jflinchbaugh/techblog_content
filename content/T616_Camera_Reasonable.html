<p>I've been snapping pictures with my T616 camera phone, and I've finally put up a little <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Camera_Phone/">gallery</a> with the pictures.  They look pretty decent.  Now I need to either figure out a way to submit photos directly to the gallery via email, or write my own moblog functionality for my Java blog.</p>
