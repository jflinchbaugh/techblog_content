<p>The <a href = "http://drunkandretired.com/podcast/">Drunk and Retired Podcast</a> is the <em>Beavis and Butthead</em> of software development.  I made <a href = "http://www.shoutstudios.com/~doug/blog/">Doug</a> listen to it on the way home in the car, and he hated it!  I love it!  It's definitely one of my top podcasts (netcasts?) of the week.</p>
