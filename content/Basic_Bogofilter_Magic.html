<p>I've been using <a href = "http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/">bogofilter</a> to herd spam into it's own little mailbox for later deletion/review.  My spam mailbox easily accumulated 300-500 messages a day.  I need to recognize a false-positive in there, so the volume was still quite unmanageable.</p>
<p>I used to send everything with a 0.50 (of 1.00) rating to the spam box.  Bogofilter actually has a third categorization of <i>Unsure</i>.  I'm using this categorization now and have adjusted my thresholds.  Bogofilter proved to be pretty good, so now I let it bounce anything over a 0.90, and then anything between 0.90 and 0.50 still gets saved to an actual mailbox.  This has cut my volume considerably, so I have a better chance of catching mail that shouldn't be spam.  It also keeps those border-line cases from skewing the auto-learn into producing more false-positives.</p>
