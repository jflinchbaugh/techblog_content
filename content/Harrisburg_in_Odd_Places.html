<p>I was flipping through comics and <a href = "http://www.little-gamers.com/index.php?strip_id=933">this Little Gamers one</a> caught my eye.  Well, not the comic, but Naku's little news post.  You don't often go flipping through Swedish comics and find a picture of your local news station's weather coverage.  Weird.</p>
