<p>I just <a href = "http://icculus.org/news/news.php?id=1879">downloaded</a> Unreal Tournament 2004 for Linux, so I can exercise my l33t fragging skills (ok, fine, <a href = "http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980326">falling into lava</a> skills) without having to find someone else's computer or (*shudder*) rebooting mine.  I should even have 3D support these days.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> My download was corrupted.  bzip2 complained about it.  I've tried several times now via bittorrent (I never knew I had a bittorrent client!) and via http.  It seems I won't even get a chance to even fall in the lava.</p>
