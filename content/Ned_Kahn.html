<p><a href = "http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>'s <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3">Morning Edition</a> has been running a series on Art and Science, and this morning they had a <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4524673">story about Ned Kahn's art</a>.  His designs often demonstrate scientific principles, or as he says: He builds the frame for a phenomenon.  The <a href = "http://www.nedkahn.com/">Ned Kahn website</a> has lots of pictures and content about his work.  The <a href = "http://www.nedkahn.com/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> is particularly interesting.</p>
