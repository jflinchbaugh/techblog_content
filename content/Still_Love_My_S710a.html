<p>My SonyEricsson S710a is still my favorite phone out there.  I thought I'd want the W600 to replace it, but I've seen that phone in person now, and I just don't find it to be as good of a fit for my needs.  It has more memory, but doesn't have a removable media card, and the screen is smaller.</p>
<p>The S710a just feels like more of a data device than a music device, which meets my needs.  My only remaining complaint with my S710a is the voice quality when the signal is low (in my house, unfortunately).</p>
