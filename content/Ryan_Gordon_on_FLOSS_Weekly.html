<p><a href = "http://twit.tv/floss8">FLOSS Weekly has an interview with Ryan Gordon</a>, who's had a hand in porting many games to other platforms.  Along the way, he lead quite a bit of development in SDL, and most recently ported Google Earth to Linux.  It's a great piece, and now I'm off to code my own version of Tetris again. :)</p>
