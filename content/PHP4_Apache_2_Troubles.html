<p><a href = "http://www.kimquigley.com/">Kim</a> alerted me this morning to the severe brokenness of my whole web server.  I did manage to dig up a reported bug in Debian's bug database, but the solution was to downgrade a small pile of packages or wait for the fixed PHP modules to hit the Debian package mirrors.  I've downgraded and I'm waiting now.</p>
<p>It seems to have been broken since about 3pm yesterday -- even my static or perl pages were broken.  The only thing that happened to work were the proxies (like to my JBoss server), so I hadn't noticed the trouble right away.</p>
