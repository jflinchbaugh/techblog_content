<p>I found another <a href = "http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/09/j2me1.html"> J2ME tutorial</a> out at <a href = "http://www.java.net/">Java.net</a>. This one seems to use the command-line versions of all the tools, so that'll be nice to see in place of the workbench application.  Maybe I'll be able to get some Ant tasks going when I get serious.</p>
