<p>If the day ever comes that I'm in charge of our source repository, I'm going to implement a commit hook that checks incoming code for horrible examples of style and reject the code.  Additionally, when someone submits Java code that looks like this:</p>
<pre>ResultSet DynamicUserRS = stmt.getResultSet()</pre>
<p>I'm going to have a script that dispatches my programmable <a href = "http://www.wowwee.com/robosapien/robo1/robomain.html">Robosapien</a> to kick the programmer in the shin.</p>

<p>It's such a simple disregard for convention, but it's piled on top of several other style issues, so the code in question is just making me never want to return to my desk to correct it.</p>
