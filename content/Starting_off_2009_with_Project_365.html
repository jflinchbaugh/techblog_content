<p>I'm starting 2009 out ambitiously with a group of others from the <a href = "http://flickr.com/groups/nofear">No Fear Photography</a> group, and we're doing a Project 365 -- take one photo a day and upload it to Flickr.  Most of the images from everyone can be seen tagged <a href = "http://flickr.com/photos/tags/nofear365/">nofear365</a>.</p>
<p>On the 8th day of the project, it's not feeling too difficult yet.</p>
