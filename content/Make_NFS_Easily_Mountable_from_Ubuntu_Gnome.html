<p>I reinstalled the ThinkPad with Ubuntu 8.10, and I've had to get a few things going again on there. As slick as Ubuntu has been with most things, I was expecting to be able to browse my way to my NFS shares in the house, or failing that, I'd be able to go to "nfs://nas/..." and be in business.  That's <a href = "http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=328107">not the case</a>, so I had to set up a bit for myself.</p>

<p>Using my previous Debian experience, I knew that autofs is a pretty friendly way to get filesystems mountable by normal users.  It automatically mounts a filesystem when a user first requests it, then unmounts it later when it's been idle.</p>
<p>I installed <code>autofs5</code>, <code>nfs-common</code>, etc from <code>aptitude</code>. Then I uncommented the <code>/net</code> line in <code>/etc/auto.master</code>, and restarted autofs.  At this point, I could just cd into <code>/net/nas</code>, and autofs would get it mounted for me, even as a user.</p>
<p>To make it easy from Gnome, I created a Custom Launcher on the Panel for the "Location", <code>file:///net/nas/</code>, and it becomes easily clickable to open it.</p>
