Over the years,
I've chosen my mobile devices
pretty carefully.
I've usually chosen them
for connectivity options,
Java capabilities,
and eventually the quickest Android updates.

  This was my first device: GSM on a small start-up network in Lancaster.

  After my old phone carrier let all their cool features
  (email to SMS) fall into disrepair,
  I jumped to an older TDMA network
  on AT&T, but it worked.

  This was my second phone on AT&T.
  This one had a couple colors and a better WAP browser,
  so I started coding WAP mobile sites for it.

  A friend gave me this tiny phone with an attachable camera accessory.
  This was my first phone with Bluetooth data tethering.

  Now I had an integrated camera and Java,
  and I think I likely started coding for J2ME apps and games
  with the T616.

  This was just an update to the T616.

  This device had an odd form factor
  of a large screen and hidden keypad
  that made it more of a camera that had a phone feature.

  I returned to the tiny, featureful candy-bar phone with this one.
  Java capabilities and connectivity remained my most important concerns.
  I was really stretching these little feature phones
  to do as much as possible, and I believed they continued
  to have a future.
  This device was a "Walkman"-branded device,
  so it had a bit of storage and decent audio capabilities.
  I think I also flashed a new firmware onto this device
  to get full email support.

  I jumped to a smartphone with Symbian OS with the full keyboard
  and internet capabiliites.
  I never coded any S60 apps for this,
  but it continued to run Java apps well.

  I finally jumped to Android and a touchscreen,
  and I had every intention of jumping right
  to coding Android apps.
  (Spoiler: With all these Android devices, I _never_ started.)
  I really stretched this device to a point
  where I barely had enough memory to run
  GPS navigation (Waze) and podcasts (BeyondPod) or music
  at the same time.

  I continued to chase clean Google Android devices.
  This devices brought NFC and wireless charging
  that didn't work as well as it should.
* https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nexus_6p-7588.php[Huawei Nexus 6P]
  This phone was huge, and I never went back to smaller phones,
  but it lost wireless charging.
  It lasted long enough for me
  to need to replace the built-in battery.
  I started coding some mobile JavaScript for this device.

  The 6P's battery died again,
  and the latest phones (Pixel 3) were being released in 6 months,
  so I bought a refurbished Pixel XL
  to tide me over,
  but it proved to be an excellent phone,
  so I hung onto it until it no longer got updates.

  I wanted something newer that would get Android 11,
  so I bought this device refurbished.
  I had to buy some headphone adapters,
  but I've been enjoying having good wireless charging.
  I finally got started with some ClojureScript
  for mobile web apps on this device.
