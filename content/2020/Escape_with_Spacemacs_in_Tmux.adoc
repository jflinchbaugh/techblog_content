I've occasionally
been using a SSH session
from my Pixel phones
for years to login
to my servers
and write Clojure code
in Emacs. 
I'd often run into an issue
where I find myself
having a weird time
switching between NORMAL and INSERT modes
when I'd hit ESCAPE quickly
and try to move the cursor.

Googling my random problems
is a favorite pastime,
and I've finally stumbled
upon an article about 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12312178/tmux-and-vim-escape-key-being-seen-as-and-having-long-delay/13843382#13843382[tmux and vim escape key].
I learned
that it's probably been `tmux`
sporadically eating my ESCAPE key,
so I've tried disabling the built-in delay
by adding to my
https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/rc/blob/master/tmux.conf[`.tmux.conf`]:
----
set -g -s escape-time 0
