A recent New York Times article
exposes that
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html[
Donald Trump paid no income taxes for 10 of 15 years
].
To some, that sounds like neglecting
a duty to the public
and the nation that makes so much possible for us.
To just as many,
that sounds like an ad
for the next big tax preparation service
they need to hire.

*Will this change anyone's view of anything?*
No.

*Do I benefit from public spending?*
Absolutely.

*Do I pay for it in taxes?*
Of course.

*Do I like the way some tax dollars are spent?*
No, so maybe I _should_ want to reduce it,
but really we need to fix the way it's spent.

*Do I take deductions I can find?*
Yes, I pay a tax professional
to tell me what to deduct
and how I can save money.
Why is this not simpler?
Why is it so hard to know what we really owe?
Why is there an entire industry
built around avoiding our responsibility to pay taxes?

I'll not sing anthems or salute a flag,
but I'll pay taxes
and vote for people who spend the money
to provide more stability for people.
