A recent New York Times article
exposes that
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html[
Donald Trump paid no income taxes for 10 of 15 years
].
To some, that sounds like neglecting
a duty to the public
and the nation that makes so much possible for us.
To just as many,
that sounds like an ad
for the next big tax preparation service
they need to hire.
Read the article,
and you'll see it's
a complicated shell game
of write-offs, profits, losses, and fees
shuffled around from year to year,
even to past years
as tax laws changed.

*Will this change anyone's view of anything?*
No.

*Do I benefit from public spending?*
Absolutely.

*Do I pay for it in taxes?*
Of course.

*Do I like the way some tax dollars are spent?*
No, so maybe I _should_ want to reduce it,
but really we need to fix the way it's spent.

*Do I take deductions I can find?*
Yes, I pay a tax professional
to tell me what to deduct
and how I can save money.
Why is this not simpler?
Why is it so hard to know what we really owe?
Why is there an entire industry
built around avoiding our responsibility to pay taxes?
Tax laws are changed and complicated
to sweeten the deal
for some lawmaker who's signing,
or in some cases,
the complication or loopholes
are often unintended consequences
that were supposed to help someone else in need.

I'll not sing anthems or salute a flag,
but I'll pay taxes
and vote for people who spend the money
to provide more stability for people.

As the shells continue to shuffle
the margins will tighten,
so I really hope we get him
out of office
before his debts come due
and he's selling off our futures.
