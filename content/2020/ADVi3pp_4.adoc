I had a bit of downtime
with my
https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=15711[Monoprice Maker Select Plus]
3D printer,
so I decided it was time
to upgrade the custom firmware,
https://www.patreon.com/andrivet/posts[ADVi3++] 3.0.x,
to the newer 4.0.6.

I've done the upgrade previously
to get the 3.x firmware in the first place,
so I knew I needed to upgrade in 2 steps:
the LCD via a microSD card
and the main board
via https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura[Cura]
over USB.

I dug through the manuals and directions a bit,
and decided I could copy the contents
of the raw zip
onto a formatted SD card
instead of writing the `img` file
to the raw SD device with `dd`.
That fit on a handy 2GiB card.
I took the couple screws out of the front panel,
inserted the micro SD card,
powered it up,
and watched the LCD display all the new images it was loading.
When it's done, I turned it off,
and replaced the screws.

Then I could easily connect the printer
to the Linux laptop via USB,
and upload the custom firmware `hex` file
from Cura's Manage Printers screen.
I did need to take a moment
to add my user to the `dialout` group
to get access to the USB ports
for serial communication
to the printer.

Upon reboot,
the printer wiped out the old incompatible settings,
and I rebooted it again to see the new startup screen
and version numbers.
I ran through some tunings: PID and extruder,
and kicked off a test print that went fine.

I currently have the thermal protection enabled,
and I'm hoping it's not too sensitive,
and I can keep it turned on.
I expect this upgrade will hold for a long time
until I see 5.0 available,
and it's had some time to settle.
