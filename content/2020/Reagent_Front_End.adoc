For the past couple days,
I've started playing with https://reagent-project.github.io/[Reagent]
to do a bit of React programming.
I used the
https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-frontend-template[Reagent-frontend]
template for leiningen to get my start.
Within a day or two,
I had managed to string together
a useful little toy application.
It only took me a couple hours
to get my next toy application
put together.
Each application is a mere
single-page application
for doing a single, simple task
on a mobile device.
It's a lot of fun,
and this opens the door
for quickly implementing any toy
I want.
