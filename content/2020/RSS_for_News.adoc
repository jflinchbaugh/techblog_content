We can find ourselves thinking,
"Where did we used to get our news
before Twitter and Facebook?"
I know where I got news:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader[Google Reader],
but Google shut it down,
and eventually gave us a taste
of aggregated news
in https://assistant.google.com/[Google Assistant]
on our phones,
but it never really allows us to consciously control it.

Social media's a bit of a mess
and mostly getting worse,
so you might want an alternative.
Google Reader was based on RSS and Atom news feeds
from all your favorite websites,
and those still exist.

I still read my carefully curated news feeds
using https://feedly.com[Feedly]
as a successor to Google Reader.
I have hundreds of different news feeds
aggregated into this one place
(kind of like Facebook and Twitter),
but it's a much more controlled
stream of news about which I care.
Anyone can create an account
at Feedly and get started
by searching for a handful
of sites you'd like to read regularly.
Over time, you can extend
and finely tune your feed of news.

If Feedly isn't quite your style,
you can find other news readers,
and allow yourself to stay informed
without necessarily needing
to scroll through all the noise
of Facebook and Twitter.
