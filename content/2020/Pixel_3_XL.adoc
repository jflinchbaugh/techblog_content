In Summer of 2018,
I had a https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nexus_6p-7588.php[Nexus 6P]
that was on its last legs,
and I couldn't quite wait
for the Pixel 3 phones to be released in the Fall,
so I picked up
a refurbished https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_xl-8345.php[Pixel XL]
to tide me over
until I could see the new devices.
That Pixel XL was fantastic,
so I just kept it for nearly 2 years.
Back in October,
the Pixel XL got its last OS update,
and I've now started seeing news
of Android 11 previews,
so I got the itch to replace the old Pixel XL
even though it still runs pretty well.

I finally got that
https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_3_xl-9257.php[Pixel 3 XL]
just a year and a half later.
Compared to the Pixel 3a XL,
I figured I'd appreciate the higher screen resolution
and the bit of water resistance.
This device doesn't seem too much different
from my old Pixel XL,
though now I'm buying a couple headphone adapters,
and I might just end up using
my cheap bluetooth headphones more.
I'm excited to have wireless charging again,
which I had given up with my
https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_4_e960-5048.php[Nexus 4].
The front-firing stereo speakers
are back and sounding good,
but it's an adjustment
from the way I used to carry the Pixel XL
with the single speaker blasting podcasts
from a pocket as I wander the house.
It seems that maybe driving
the extra speaker may drain battery
a little quicker.
After a couple days,
I had to pop into the Developer Options
to hide the notch.
It's just a bad idea:
I have too many notifications
to allow room for a notch cut out
between them.

The Pixel 3 XL seems pretty well-balanced
with features I want at a reasonable price
(about $300 USD for the refurbished one).
I already have the March 2020 update
before I've even owned the device for a week,
and I should have updates through 2021.
When updates run out, I'll look at upgrading again.
I'll need to find a use for the original Pixel
as a webcam or something,
since it's still in such good shape
and had plenty of computing power.
