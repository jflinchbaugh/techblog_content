<p>Via Digg, I stumbled upon a video of Richard Dawkins answering a <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=6mmskXXetcg#">simple question</a>.</p>
<p>I'm apparently to understand that he's demonstrating all these other odd beliefs which we don't believe and could equally be subject to <em>those</em> hells for disbelief, and Christianity provides just one more example.  Unfortunately, his style of delivery feels more like an attack, so his subtle point could easily be missed -- I agree with the guy, but I missed it at first.  I was terribly disappointed.</p>
