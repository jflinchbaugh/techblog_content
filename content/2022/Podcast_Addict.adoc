I've used BeyondPod for over 10 years,
since my first Android phone,
to download, organize, and play podcasts.
For at least the past 4 years,
maintenance and updates
to the application
have slowed to a crawl.
I had paid a one-time fee
for the application,
so I guess I couldn't
think they owed me updates forever.

I would try to find a replacement
every once in a while,
but the other podcatchers
always lacked some feature
upon which I relied.

=== BeyondPod: The Good Parts

* SmartPlay allowed me to organize my 74 podcasts
  into 3 or 4 tiers.
  This allowed me
  to ensure the quick, timely podcasts
  were played first
  before the longer podcasts that could wait
  for days or weeks.
  I even managed to create one tier
  that played chronologically,
  which is opposite of all my other podcasts.
* I could set a volume boost
  and adjust speed 
- volume boost
- custom speeds for each feed
- keep latest X episodes
- skip to end button

* key features of beyondpod
- smartplay:
  - tiering podcast and prioritizing
  - sort tiers differently (old->new for a relisten)
- volume boost
- custom speeds for each feed
- keep latest X episodes
- skip to end button
* downsides of beyondpod
- unmaintained
- opml exports to FS that became protected in newer android, so no way to get it
- crashes
- custom notification controls instead of media controls
- limited trust that it'll install again on android 13
- bug in forward skip into next episode (race condition)
* podcast addict
- even faster speeds
- per podcast
  - volume boost
  - speed
  - auto cleanup by age or count (keep latest X episodes)
- sort by priorities
- "smart priorities" automatically increment priority when manually chosen to play
  - turned it off, so i can just bump them around myself
- episode artwork
- episode chapters (under extra controls, bookmark button)
- skip silence works well, but is super-weird for story podcasts.
