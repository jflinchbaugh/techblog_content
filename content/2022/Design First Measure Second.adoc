https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/objects/[My objects repository]
is full of
https://openscad.org/[OpenSCAD]
code.
At the top
of each file
you'll find a collection
of variables
in the code:
the measurements
of the model.

We don't need
to get bogged down
with those exact values
to start modeling,
but we know
that we'll want
to identify
certain parameters
to size our models.
We can start banging
together some shapes
(with `union` and `difference`),
and any time 
we're tempted to guess
at a measurement
and plug it into the code,
we want to first see
if we can give it a name
(a variable name, that is)
and use that instead
and define a rough value
for that variable at the top of the file.
Next we can think
about that value
and decide if it's related
to any other values
we already have.
Often,
one value should
be calculated
relative to other values:
`overall_width = inside_width + 2 * side_thickness`.
Once a measurement
is defined
in terms of other values
it'll automatically update
as we start providing
more precise measurements.

By starting
with some guessed values
and later
plugging in real measurements,
we prove
that our
_parametric model_
is being correctly calculated
from the measurements.
We should be able
to use this code
time and time again
to generate variations
on the model
based on new measurements.
