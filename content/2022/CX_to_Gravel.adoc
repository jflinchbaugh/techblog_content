I bought my first _new_ bicycle
in December of 2020.
I had been using
my previous bike
much more through 2020,
so I figured I had proven
I'd use an upgraded bike.
Ben and I
had been aggressively researching
gravel bikes for a while,
but any bike had 
been hard to find
in stock.

We found a used cyclocross bike,
the https://99spokes.com/bikes/redline/2015/conquest-elite[Redline Conquest Elite],
that looked enough like a gravel bike.
It luckily was a good size
for me, a small.
The drop handlebars 
were exciting and different for me.

Over the year I've had the bike,
I've added lots of parts
and swapped others.
I made the carbon fiber bike heavier
but it met my needs
and make it look more
like a gravel bike:

* I replaced the stem
  to shorten it a bit.
* I switched to a suspension seat post.
* I added a top-tube bag,
  a tool bag behind the saddle,
  a phone mount,
  a bright headlight,
  and a clamp-on rack in the back.
* It came with 35mm CX tires,
  so I purchased other gravel tires
  from Vittoria in the same size.
  The new tires were smoother,
  but clearance seemed a bit tighter.
  I've very recently swapped
  to a narrower 31mm rear tire
  to have better
  clearance for mud.
* The original groupset
  on my bike was built
  for a stronger road rider:
  36T/46T chain rings
  paired with an 11-28 cassette.
  I needed a little more help climbing,
  but I liked the speed
  of the faster gears.
  I first replaced the 36T ring
  with a 34T,
  and then I found
  an 11-34 cassette.
  This goes about as slow
  as I need to go up a hill,
  but retains those high,
  fast gears
  for me.

I know the bike's not really
a gravel bike,
but I think I have myself convinced
enough that it'll work for me,
and I don't need to shop
for the next bike.
I've already ridden
over 100 miles this year,
and I'm feeling pretty strong
with this current configuration.
