My Google Assistant on my phone
has been refusing to turn on and off
the 2 devices I have on smart plugs:
"Can't reach SmartThings."

I found an article
about the
https://community.smartthings.com/t/google-home-error-sorry-i-couldnt-reach-smartthings/192814/10[Google Home doing the same thing].
Fortunately,
the advice there worked:
go into Assistant's settings
-> Devices
-> Add Devices.
Upon clicking on the SmartThings entry
that was already there,
it gave me the option to re-link.
Once I authorized access,
I could again ask Google
to control those devices.
