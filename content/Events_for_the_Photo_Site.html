<p>Way back in the day, when I used to shoot at clubs and <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Raves/">raves</a>, I'd always want a way to share the images with the people I'd meet, but exchanging email could be a bit cumbersome or just be a deterrent.</p>
<p>While I'm not out clubbing these days, I'm still often out at various events, so I still need a quick and easy way to point people to the images, so I just added the Event Code box to <a href = "http://www.johnflinchbaugh.com/">the photo site</a>.</p>

<p>While I'm out shooting, I can create an event code (from imagination or using my phone), and then write <em>that</em> short code on my business card to hand out.  Then it's really easy for someone to hit my site, punch in the code, and get right to the photos on Flickr or in the Gallery.</p>
<p>It's just one of those little things I've wanted for a while, and now I've finally added it.</p>
