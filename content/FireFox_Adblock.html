<p>I've just loaded the <a href = "https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=10&amp;application=firefox">Adblock</a> extension for FireFox.  It's changed the way I browse, at least initially, and that's not necessarily a good thing.</p>
<p>My first odd feeling hit as I blocked <code>googlesyndication.com</code>, and it made all the Google Ads go away.  I actually think Google Ads are novel, since they try to intelligently target the user, and they're minimally intrusive on most sites.  If I were to put ads on any of my sites, I'd probably go with Google Ads.</p>
<p>In the end, though, I blocked it because I could!  I may unblock that at some point.  I almost never click on the ads, so I guess I'm not really robbing the sites of ad revenue by just not showing them.</p>
<p>Secondly, I browse differently now.  I hit a site, and the first thing I do is search for ads to block, check the Adblock list to see if anything's already been blocked, <em>then</em> I go read the site.  It's the thrill of the hunt! (I'm such a geek.)</p>
