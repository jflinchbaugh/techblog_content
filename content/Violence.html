<p>Some guy in Israel blew himself up on a bus.  In the middle of peace talks, someone (Israeli or Palestinian) always does something to put it on hold or tear down the whole process.  The talks are now on hold, and Israel is most likely mounting counter-attacks on the Palestinian settlements to take their turn at a round of senseless killing.</p>
<p>In other news, I've brought a life into this world, and for the rest of my life I'll have to worry about a cruel and vicious world preying on her.  At the very least, I'll need to figure out how to explain this to her.</p>
<p>Lots of innocent adults and children were injured or killed on that bus.  One child was only a year and a half old.  People just can't see the greater good of just letting go of their hate.  Everyone has lost someone to the other side, so they feel justified in killing.  The cycle just continues with no end.</p>
<p>I've never experienced such a day-to-day life as they do over there, but I'd  like to think I'd be able to wait it out and let peace prevail.  I can't understand that lack of respect for human life.  Of course, I'd probably be one of the innocent people to die while waiting and hoping for peace.</p>
