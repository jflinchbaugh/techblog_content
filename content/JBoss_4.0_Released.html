<p><a href = "http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a> released <a href = "http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=24779&amp;group_id=22866">version 4.0.0</a> of their server yesterday.  I've been using the JBoss from the 2.x days with good results.  I look forward to trying out 4.0.0.  I'm not sure when I'll get around to it though.  Upgrades haven't been painful, but they've been time consuming.  I expect a major release like this to be considerably more work.</p>
