<p>NPR has an article about <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4486840">Pioneers of Electronic Music</a> back in 1947.</p>
<p>I wish I had caught this on the radio, but it's a membership campaign season on WITF, so it's barely worth turning to that station for actual content.  I'll have to check out the clips.</p>
