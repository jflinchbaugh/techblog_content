<p>Smith LaVia studio will have their grand opening on October's First Friday in Lancaster!  I'm one of the resident photographers, so I'll be showing some work and hanging out for the night along with the 4 other photographers (and a painter).  It's sure to be a good time, so stop by and say "Hello".</p>
<p>The studio is located at:</p>
<blockquote>
Suite 210<br/>
329 N Queen St<br/>
Lancaster, PA<br/>

</blockquote>
<p>I'll be using the studio to show work, to shoot, and to host workshops.</p>
