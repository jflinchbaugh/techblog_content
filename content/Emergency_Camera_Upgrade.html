<p>An emergency upgrade is still an upgrade, and that'll be a Nikon D90 for me.</p>
<p>We went hiking on Saturday at Tucquan Glen, and I started out the trip with a photo of some interesting fungus, then dropping my D40 (and a 50mm f/1.8) into the creek as I tried to cross on a log with the kids.</p>
<p>I bent over to reach something, and the camera strap slid off my left shoulder.  Claire and I both watched this happen in slow motion, but often the camera strap is clipped in a carabiner on my bag. We watched in slow motion as the camera slid and kept going -- either of us could have grabbed it, but didn't -- and it plopped right into the creek and rolled once in the current.</p>
<p>Claire stepped in real quick and grabbed the camera, but it was soaked through.</p>
<p>It's been drying for a couple days, but it still just beeps and freaks out when I try to turn it on, so I don't expect much from it.</p>
<p>After having borrowed Stacey's D90 for an evening, I've ordered a D90 to replace my D40.  It should be a very nice upgrade, but I really wish I didn't need it.  I'm going to miss the quiet, little D40 with its fast flash sync speed, but somehow, I think I'll be fine.</p>
