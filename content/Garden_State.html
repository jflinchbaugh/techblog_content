<p>Claire and I found <a href = "http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/gardenstate/">Garden State</a> to be a great movie that both of us could actually enjoy.  I highly recommend it if you like your humor a bit dark and absurd.  There are so many funny little <a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/quotes">lines</a> that I'd love to be able to quote in real life.  The soundtrack is quite nice too.  It's very distinctive and will always remind you of bits of the movie.</p>
<p>I love <a href = "http://gardenstate.typepad.com/">Zach Braff</a>'s work on the Scrubs TV show, and this movie didn't disappoint.  I really must wonder how he gets the opportunity to write, direct, and star in his own movie for a big production company.  After watching <a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420917/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9c25vd2JhbGwgZWZmZWN0fGh0bWw9MXxubT1vbg__;fc=1;ft=1">Snowball Effect: The Story of Clerks</a>, I'd think it's nearly impossible to make the strides Zach has.</p>
