<p>Dinger has driven me nuts with his weblog on a number of occassions now. <strong>Implement comments in your software already!  Aarrgh!</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, <a href = "http://www.champagneblonde.us/article.php?id=60">Dinger questions</a> Kerry's <a href = "http://www.johnkerry.com/pdf/pr_2004_0525b_a.pdf">improvements</a> to the Patriot Act.  If Dinger had read past the headline, he'd see on page 2 of that document, one of the improvements really is an improvement -- bring judges back into the process of approving surveillance to be more like traditional warrants.  The bill's biggest problems have been unbalanced power and lack of controls.  Judges represent that control.</p>
