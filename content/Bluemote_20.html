<p><a href = "http://www.shoutstudios.com/~doug/blog/">Doug</a> pointed out that <a href = "http://www.geocities.com/saravkrish/progs/bluemote/">Bluemote 2.0</a> is out.  It's quite nice.  The author's added support for events, so your computer can know when you walk away, get an incoming call, etc.</p>
<p>The new configuration is a bit nicer, but more complex, and I guess I just missed the part in the documentation where it asks you to create a <code>~/.bluemote</code> directory, so it can create its lock file.  It only took me 10 minutes or so of debugging to get it all working nicely.</p>
