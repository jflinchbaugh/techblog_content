<p>MySpace is being <a href = "http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/20/myspace_sued">sued for the sexual assault of a 14-year-old</a>.</p>
<p>At no point in this kid's life was it ever safe to talk to strangers or invite them over to play tea party, no matter what the communication medium.  Additionally, she seems to have a parent who's there when it's time to litigate, so where was Mom when the pedophiles were chatting up the kid?</p>
<p>So who do you think is the "irresponsible generation"?</p>
