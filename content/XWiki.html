<p><a href = "http://www.xwiki.org/">XWiki</a> looks like a package I'd like to try.  I think I've always regarded my weblog as a personal knowledge base, like a Wiki.  Versioning could be useful, but the weblog trackback/comment web has intriguing uses as well.</p>
<p>The XWiki sites I've seen look very nice, in that the maintenance/admin functionality doesn't get in the way of the real content.  I'll probably download, install, and play with it sometime soon.</p>
