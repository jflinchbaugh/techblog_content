<p>I really need to clean up the interface to my blog.  I find it absolutely charming , but it's really lacking navigation and features.  I intend to add an explorer-like nav bar on the left (like a file tree) and a menu across the top.  You'd think I'm a fan of programming IDEs or something, but I'm not.  I just think it would be a nice look, and <code>vi(1)</code> just doesn't provide enough of an interface to emulate on a web page!</p>
<p>I'll use struts-tiles which make that stuff look easy enough.  I just have to work out the css for it.  I'm challenging myself to not use tables and use css instead.  I could probably more completely implement current navigation as well.  You may have noticed, I have sort of standard hard-coded dump points for some actions, which is annoying.</p>
<p>The other java-based weblog packages out there seem sort of featureful, but I suffer severely of NCHS (Not Coded Here Syndrome), so I'm still writing my own for the practice.  I mean, that's what this is all about, right?  I'm learning struts here, which is the tier all those others have implemented.  If I was merely interested in EJB work, I'd grab one of the others and implement an EJB tier under it.</p>
