<p>Bachelor Week 2013 (where Claire and kids ran off to the beach and left me behind) started out with <a href = "https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/116753238490512931408/albums/5902642308660323361">photographing</a> at the <a href = "http://www.mengesmillssteam.com/">Menges Mills Tractor Show</a> for the third year, and the week ended with a quick road trip after work to join the family for a day on the beach.</p>
<p>In between, I got to a party with some photographer friends, sat in front of the computer for many, many hours catching up on photo processing for the Project 365 (whew!) and beyond.  I also managed to have some friends over for an Xbox night to play a little good old Halo 2 and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_%26_All-Stars_Racing_Transformed">Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed</a>.</p>
<p>While continuing to go to work, I listened to podcasts like crazy (at <a href = "http://www.beyondpod.com/Android/">1.5x speed!</a>) to get caught up on all the news in technology and photography.</p>
<p>It was a much-needed reset, and I was glad to rejoin the family at the end of the week (and start adding to my photo backlog again)!</p>
