<p>Linux 2.6.1 was released nearly 7 hrs ago, and I just booted it on my laptop.  It's a rapid upgrade cycle which is fun.  I'm getting overly-confident now, though, and I'm tempted to boot the new kernel on butterfly from 45 miles away.  I'll see if I can hold off.  If you see butterfly go away for half a day, you'll know I was put back in my place.</p>
<p>Now I just need to get Todd to be ambitious and overly-confident about <a href = "http://cs.millersville.edu/">his network</a>.  He needs some excitement, right?  Has anyone else I know been booting the 2.6 kernels on interesting or important machines, yet?</p>
<p><b>Update (9:53am):</b> Ok, so I didn't really try to wait that long.  Anyway, it works! ;)  I rule.</p>
