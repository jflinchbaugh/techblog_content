I've moved the blog to a static site generated by
http://jbake.org/[JBake]. The source for the content 
lives in my 
https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/techblog_content[Github project].

I initialized it with the Groovy templating engine and have started
customizing it.  I'll continue to customize it, and eventually break
out another instance of it for the photography blog.

I've been collecting a long list of (mostly technical) articles to
write, but replacing the old platform kept trumping my attempts to
write.  Hopefully, this can open the flood gates.
