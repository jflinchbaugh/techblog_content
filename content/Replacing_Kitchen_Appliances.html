<p>Our Amana refrigerator which came with the house died over the weekend.  It's been in the process of a long, slow death for a while, but I had been hoping to correct the problem with some rigorous cleaning and parts jiggling.</p>
<p>Claire found a cool website with parts diagrams and prices (since it was a parts store), so we knew we were in for $200 in parts (fan and compressor) plus some hefty labor fees, since it would require discharging and recharging the cooling system.</p>
<p>On this information, we decided to just replace the whole refrigerator with a big, but cheap one from Lowes.  This is how we buy all our appliances -- We pick the "big class" of appliance, then buy the cheapest from that class.</p>
<p>I'm really torn though.  As a society, we insist on buying everything so cheap that it's impractical to actually repair anything.  For the cost of even the simplest repair, we just buy a new appliance and ship the old one off to the landfill.  I've completely fed into tha cycle with my purchase of an ultra-cheap refrigerator.  I <u>am</u> going to see if I can find a place which can take the old one and recycle it, but I don't expect to be successful, and it'll just end up in the landfill regardless.  The sheer size of the appliance amplifies this concern in my mind.</p>
<p>Now we've replaced the fridge and the dishwasher, and I've had to service the garbage disposer.  The only thing left to go is the stove or the plumbing.  I can't think of a way to break the electric stove, but I fear we'll find out at some time.</p>
