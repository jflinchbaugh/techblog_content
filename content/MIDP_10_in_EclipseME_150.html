<p>Yesterday, I was having <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Difficulty_with_EclipseME_150__WTK_22">trouble getting MIDP 1.0 going on EclipseME</a>.  My steps to getting it working were pretty rough, but Craig Setera responded to my mailing list inquiries with a more straight-forward approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <em>J2ME Device Management Preferences</em>.</li>
<li>Duplicate the device which most closely matches what you want, such as <em>DefaultColorPhone</em>.</li>
<li>Edit the new device</li>
<li>Edit the Device Name to something more recognizable, like <em>DefaultColorPhone MIDP1.0/CLDC1.0</em>.</li>
<li>Edit the <em>Launch Command Template</em> to hardcode a device name that the WTK will accept, instead of the new device name: <code>-Xdevice:%device%</code> becomes <code>-Xdevice:DefaultColorPhone</code>.</li>
<li>Switch to the <em>Libraries</em> tab.</li>
<li>Add the jars for the older specs:
<ul>
<li><code>cldcapi10.jar</code></li>
<li><code>midpapi10.jar</code></li>
<li><code>wma11.jar</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove the jars for the newer specs:
<ul>
<li><code>cldcapi11.jar</code></li>
<li><code>midpapi20.jar</code></li>
<li><code>wma20.jar</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Save the changes to the preferences.</li>
<li>Restart Eclipse. This seemed necessary to get the Launch Command reloaded.</li>
<li>Edit your project properties, and switch to the new device profile.</li>
<li>Rebuild project.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, I was happily up and running again.</p>
<p>On a side note: I was working in a new workspace to test this, so I had to do a fresh checkout of my project from SVN and create a J2ME Midlet Suite project from it.  This process had been very painful in much older versions of EclipseME and Subclipse.  I was never sure which package was causing the errors, but today, it works just fine.  I'm pleased, because getting another person's enviroment setup won't take the hand-holding and black magic it once did.</p>
