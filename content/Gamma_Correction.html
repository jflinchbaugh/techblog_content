<p>Looking at the new design for <a href = "http://insanity.lost-angel.com/blog/">Stacey's site</a>, I noticed that the colors appeared quite differently on my notebook's LCD and my work computer's CRT.</p>
<p>This <a href = "http://trikuare.cx/art/tut/gamma/">monitor calibration</a> site helped me tune my display's individual RGB gamma corrections, so the colors really show as they're meant to be seen.  I used <code>xgamma</code> to adjust my gamma settings on the fly and saved the settings into my <code>XF86Config-4</code> file.  My LCD looks much richer now and not as washed out.</p>
<p>I expect this will greatly improve the quality of images that I edit on my notebook as well.</p>
