<p>I seem to have popped the pin from my current watch for the last time, so it looks like it's time to shop for a new watch.  Has anyone seen any truly cool gadget watches?</p>
<p>Casio and Timex do cool things, but they don't adequately combine those features into ONE watch.  In the same watch, I'd really like a thermometer and the capability to set its own time according to radio time signals.  Those are the big features I want, but Casio would have me buy 2 different watches to get those features.</p>
<p>I had a Timex DataLink watch, but it's really not as useful as you'd think.  I'm not sure I need storage.  Citizen also makes the Eco-Drive watches which have solar faces.  Those are neat but very expensive -- I have good taste in solar watches I guess.</p>
