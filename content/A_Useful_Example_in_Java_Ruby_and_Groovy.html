<p>We've been using Java and Ruby for work, and we've recently been asked to look more toward Groovy where we had been using Ruby, so I rewrote a useful little iconv script which we use to re-encode large volumes of data (which the GNU iconv doesn't seem to want to handle).</p>
<p>For illustration, here are the implementations I wrote:</p>
<p>Java (40 lines):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>import java.io.*;

public class Iconv {
    public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {
        if (args.length &lt; 2) {
            System.out.println(
                    "Usage: Iconv &lt;in&gt;:&lt;encoding&gt; &lt;out&gt;:&lt;encoding&gt;");
            return;
        }

        final String[] ins = args[0].split(":");
        final String[] outs = args[1].split(":");

        final String inFile = ins[0];
        final String inEnc = ins[1];
        final String outFile = outs[0];
        final String outEnc = outs[1];

        Writer writer = null;
        try {
            writer = new OutputStreamWriter(
                    new FileOutputStream(outFile), outEnc);
            Reader reader = null;
            try {
                reader = new InputStreamReader(
                        new FileInputStream(inFile), inEnc);
                Integer character = null;
                while ((character = reader.read()) >= 0) {
                    writer.write(character);
                }
            } finally {
                if (reader != null)
                    reader.close();
            }
        } finally {
            if (writer != null)
                writer.close();
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>Using the Groovy 1.6 beta, I could have used the new left-side array assignment syntax to shorten the groovy version to 15 lines:</p>
<pre>...
[from, fromEnc] = args[0].split(":")
...</pre>
<p>I had initially set out to skip over Groovy and just learn Ruby, as I had viewed Groovy as a sort of compromise -- Ruby would be the real twist of the mind, but alas, my neural pathways seem a bit more rigid than I had hoped.  I can think a little quicker in Groovy than Ruby and get a few things done.  Groovy is also a bit more compatible with the work directives handed down from on high -- we want to be a Java shop.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2008-06-04):</strong> I updated the code above to reflect some comments.  To be complete, the Java code should null check the streams it's trying to close in the finally blocks.</p>
