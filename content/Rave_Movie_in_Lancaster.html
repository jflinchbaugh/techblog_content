<p>Todd sent me a link about Jay Ingram, host of he <a href = "http://www.exn.ca/dailyplanet/">Daily Planet on Discovery Channel Canada</a>, making a <a href = "http://www.thewgalchannel.com/entertainment/3783075/detail.html">rave movie</a> or something in Lancaster.  I hope Mr. Ingram's intentions are honorable, though I can't really tell.  Will it be a sensational "expose" into the dark side of the rave culture (which also exists at other music events) or something a bit less damning?</p>
<p>I must wonder what he could possibly find in Lancaster.  It's not exactly a happening scene anymore, especially with the Smithgall Gestapo raiding clubs in past years.</p>
<p>There <i>are</i> some long-time supporters around here.  I get out on rare occassions, but I often see some of the same people I've always seen over the years.</p>
