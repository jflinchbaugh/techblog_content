<p>Digging through Google referers, I found a forum link of someone <a href = "http://www.experts-exchange.com/Web/Web_Languages/JSP/Q_20720211.html">asking for a Perl to JSP conversion tool</a>.  <i>*Sigh*</i>  How can you not recognize that it's a completely different programming paradigm (OO), or how about just a completely different syntax for function calls, etc?</p>
<p>If anyone had actually bothered to respond and tell them that they actually need to code, not just take 10 minutes and feed the large and complex source code to a tool (step 3: Profit!), I bet the next question would be, "How do I write JSP?".</p>
<p>The worst part is that they probably already have the contract to do this job with their unwitting customer.</p>
