<p>My shiny new <a href = "http://www.johnflinchbaugh.com/photography/">John Flinchbaugh Photography</a> website is now live. A long chain of dependencies all led back to needing a website, so I finally sat down and got it done.</p>
<p>For tech folks, it's a Grails 1.1.1 application packaged up as a WAR to run in my existing JBoss instance.  I hope to eventually replace the JBoss instance with a plain Tomcat when I get a chance to port the old legacy applications that run there.</p>
<p>My next steps, if you couldn't guess from looking at it, is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feed my Flickr sets into the <a href = "http://www.johnflinchbaugh.com/photography/images">Images</a> page in place of just having links.</li>
<li>Build in a photography-specific blog in place of the current link to here.</li>
</ul>
