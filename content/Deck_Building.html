<p>Last weekend, my Dad and I started building the new deck onto my house.  It'll look quite nice when it's done.  The only problem is getting really started.  We did pretty well the first day, but that was followed with lots of snow, so it's been pretty slow moving since then.  My neighbors probably think I'm out of my mind.</p>
<p>Really, the weather hasn't actually been that bad, as long as I keep moving.  If we delay building until Spring, though, I'll be on my own, which would be bad.  My Dad camps most weekends from early March to October, so this is the time slot in which I have to build.</p>
<p>Once I get the deck plans redrawn, I'll see if I can post them here.</p>
