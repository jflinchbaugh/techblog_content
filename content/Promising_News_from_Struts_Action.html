<p>I just stumbled upon some <a href = "http://jroller.com/page/mrdon?entry=unification_struts_action_and_jsf">promising news about Struts Action having JSF support</a> from Don Brown.  I love that the configuration snippets immediately looked familiar from my recent WebWork experience.  I expected that choosing to study WebWork recently would mean I'd be ignoring JSF, but that doesn't seem to be the case now.</p>
<p>I'll continue with WebWork now, and when this new stuff matures, I'll look at transitioning.</p>
