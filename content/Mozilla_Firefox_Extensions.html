<p>Mozilla released the follow up to Firebird 0.7, which is named Firefox 0.8.  I upgraded, not knowing that all the texturizer.net resource links were going to be non-responding, so I'm searching around now for another source.</p>
<p>The tabbed-browsing extension is a must-have.  It allows the browser to open your homepage immediately upon opening a new tab, suck popup windows or new browser windows into tabs, etc.</p>
<p>Update: <a href = "http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/">MozDev's Extension Room</a> has the good stuff.  Texturizer's site says they've temporarily taken down the extensions they host to help maintain a "healthy and responsive" server.  If it's not serving what people want, who cares if it's healthy (but useless)?</p>
