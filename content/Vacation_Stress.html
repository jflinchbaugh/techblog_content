<p>I'm sort of panicked about going on vacation.  It just feels like I'm being plucked from all the stuff I'm trying to get done to allow it to all pile up for my return.  I'll be missing a very important week at work and removing myself from many of my normal technical comforts.</p>
<p>I'm trying to remain calm by reminding myself that a tethered EDGE connection is reasonable to use, and I may get some time to sit and read and work on some code.  I also look forward to chasing the kids and playing with the camera a bit.</p>
<p>Getting normal life wrapped up in preparation to drop it for a week is hard work.</p>
