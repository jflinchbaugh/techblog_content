<p>I stumbled upon a podcast of <a href = "http://www.bejug.org/confluenceBeJUG/display/PARLEYS/Closures+for+Java">Neal Gafter's talk on Closures at JavaPolis 2006</a>.  I've never used closures, so I barely grasp what they do.  I've only been listening to the audio, and I just now discovered the slides, so I'll probably need to go back and listen to it with the slides running. (That is such a cool feature of that website!)</p>
