<p>The podcast circuit has been a bit slow this summer, but an interesting one came across <a href = "http://www.itconversations.com/">ITC</a> recently.  Sam Harris was at PopTech! talking about <a href = "http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail785.html">the prevalence and absurdity of religious belief</a>.  I'm actually listening to it a second time to absorb more into my toolbox for atheist discussion.</p>
