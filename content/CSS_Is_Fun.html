<p>Something finally clicked, and I think I now understand the CSS positioning!  I restructured the entire layout to make real sense.  As an added bonus, I even solved my comment block (with the asterisks) problem.</p>
<p>The side bar is placed using absolute positioning, as are the columns of *'s.  There are no tables here at all now.  For accessibility, the menu and *'s actually exist in the source code <i>after</i> the content, so you don't have to wade through the navigation links with a text browser, pda, wap browser, or text-to-speech converter.  (Of course, everyone needs to be able to access my very important blog in all those ways several times a day.)</p>
