<p>I was previously <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Java_5_GC_Ergonomics_in_a_Small_Environment">trying the parallel throughput collector (-XX:+UseParallelGC) with ergonomics</a>, but every description I've ever <a href = "http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc5.0/gc_tuning_5.html">read</a> of this collector says it's appropriate for lots of RAM, and numerous processors.  I've observed relatively good performance in my little 192M Xen VPS.</p>
<p>The CMS collector (-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC) sounds a bit more appropriate for my small setup, so I'm testing that now.  I decided to drop the incremental mode (-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode), since it felt like the incremental collection of the tenured area may have been causing thrashing of the swap space on the machine.  It seems that no matter what I do, this Java process always needs lots of memory -- heap is limited to 40M, permanent space is limited to 50M, and thread stack is only 96K, but the server still takes up 320M+ of virtual memory.</p>
<p>Here are my current settings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>-server -Xms40m -Xmx40m -XX:MaxPermSize=50M -XX:NewRatio=5 -XX:ThreadStackSize=96 -Xss96k -XX:+UseBiasedLocking -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -verbose:gc -XX:-TraceClassUnloading</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think the NewRatio is actually having affect though, since the <code>DefNew</code> sizes in the GC logs stay the same.</p>
