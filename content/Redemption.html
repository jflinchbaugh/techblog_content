<p><a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5050214">Stanley Tookie Williams was put to death</a> this morning by the state of California.  He was convicted of his crimes and was doing his time, but never admitted guilt.</p>
<p>Disregarding the question of his innocence or guilt, we still see that he was making the best of his confined life writing and educating against gang violence.  He was doing good work, and I weep for a society that couldn't afford a redeemed man more time to spread his message.</p>
