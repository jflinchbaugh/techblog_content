<p>I ordered a paperback copy of the "Gang of Four" <a href = "http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0201633612,00.html">Design Patterns</a> textbook from an ebay vendor.  This is an attempt to make myself smart again, so I'm anxiously awaiting its arrival in the mail.  I feel like I've been falling behind in higher-order thought.</p>
