<p>Yay.  The Referer List works, and you've probably all seen me bouncing off your blogs, whoring referer links.  <i>Clicky, Clicky, five dollar!</i></p>
<p>Code is cool.  The referer list is stored in application scope, with the last day of update.  When the Referer filter sees the last day roll over, it clears the list and starts again, so the statistics are only for the current day.</p>
