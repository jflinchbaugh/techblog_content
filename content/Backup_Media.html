<p>I currently do nightly incremental backups of my server and laptop to a 3rd computer.  That computer is sitting next to the others, so it's no safer from natural disaster than the others.</p>
<p>My internet connection is too slow for full offsite backups, so I need to figure out a removable media for my backups, so I can hand them off to someone else.  Tape drives are too expensive, and the one I have now is tiny.</p>
<p>Digging for a tool to backup across multiple CDs, a tool called <a href = "http://www.muempf.de/">cdbackup</a> seems promising as it allows any datastream (tar, dump, cpio, etc) to be dumped to CD.  I'll have to give it a try real soon.</p>
<p>After glancing at <a href = "http://www.pricewatch.com/">Pricewatch</a>, though, I must wonder if it's worth the trouble, since I could just by a DVD+RW burner for ~$50.</p>
