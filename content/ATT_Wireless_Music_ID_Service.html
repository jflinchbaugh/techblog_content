<p>I just read <a href = "http://www.dailywireless.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=179&mode=&order=0&thold=0">an article</a> about AT&T Wireless' new music identification system, so I had to try it out.  I dialed "#ID" (#43), held the phone up to my tinny little laptop speaker, and about 30 seconds later it sent me a message correctly identifying Concrete Blonde's <i>Everybody Knows</i>.  Awesome!</p>
<p>The only problem is that it costs $0.99 per successful song ID.  I'm sure I'll have fun with this when I go clubbing!</p>
