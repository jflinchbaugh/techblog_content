<p>I've long used the little page-back and page-forward buttons on my ThinkPad as multimedia keys instead of paging.  The latest version of Gnome Control Center (2.18.1) on my Debian box stopped doing it properly, so I lost easy control of RhythmBox.</p>
<p>Thanks to some browsing, and the discussion on this <a href = "http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133815">bug report</a>, I figured out that it was just a matter of mapping the keycodes to the right keysyms, so now I have this in my <code>~/.Xmodmap</code> in hopes that it continues to work for me:</p>
<pre>
<code>keycode 234 = XF86AudioPlay
keycode 236 = XF86AudioNext</code>
</pre>
<p><strong>Update (30 May 2007):</strong>
This eventually broke again, and my best option to see it work was to drop the <code>.Xmodmap</code> settings and go back to letting the Gnome keyboard shortcuts do it, which seems to work again.  Whatever.  It's weird changes like this that make Claire not like my computers.</p>
