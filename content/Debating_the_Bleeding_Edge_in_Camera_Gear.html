<p>I'm listening to <a href = "http://digiphoto.thepodcastnetwork.com/2008/03/14/the-digital-photography-show-86-a-lot-of-stuff-youll-like-from-jobo-x-rite-and-xshot/">DPS 86</a>, and they're debating buying current or waiting for the latest camera bodies.</p>
<p>I used to do this with my computer gear, but I've gotten over it by dropping back a year or 2 from the bleeding edge.  Prices are better, and in the case of computers, Linux support is more complete once something's been on the market for a while.</p>
<p>Camera's make it even easier, because your just looking at the body -- it's only a fraction of the cost, and it can be eBay-ed later.  I get to keep my investment in lenses no matter what body I have.  That's why I was completely comfortable buying the D40 -- it gives me all the basic controls I need, and the rest is up to me.</p>
