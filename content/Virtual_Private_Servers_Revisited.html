<p>With Lynn <a href = "http://x.hjsoft.com/viewArticle.php?id=38">gearing up to move</a>, I need to figure out a new place to host my DNS.  Virtual private servers running user-mode linux seem to be a good option.  I'll have root, and I'll be able to do anything I want to the machine.  This initially would only be running DNS and maybe a mail relay, but I figure for the right price, I could maybe a cram a JBoss and an Apache server in there while I'm at it.</p>
<p>I had <a href = 
"http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/showArticle.java?id=18">originally</a> liked <a href = "http://www.pdxcolo.net">PDXColo</a>, but they're at  capacity right now and aren't adding any accounts.</p>
<p><a href = "http://mirroredsolutions.com/servers/index.htm">These guys</a> seem to have attractive prices.  For $15/month, I could have 128M RAM, 2G of disk, and 20G of bandwidth.  <a href = "https://www.jvds.com/virtuallist.php">JVDS</a> has cheap and tiny machines starting at $12.50.  These would not be good for a JBoss server, but their setup prices are cheaper.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any good thoughts on this?  See any other packages that look nice?  Advice?</p>
