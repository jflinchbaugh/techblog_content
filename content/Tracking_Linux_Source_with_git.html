<p>I've apparently been scanning the linux-kernel mailing list too quickly for the past couple weeks. When I saw the 2.6.12-rc3 announcement, and the mention of "git", I had no idea from where this new SCM tool came.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href = "http://kerneltrap.org/">KernelTrap</a> brought me up to speed with an article about <a href = "http://kerneltrap.org/node/4982">Linus writing his own tool, called "git"</a>.
