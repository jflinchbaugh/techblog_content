<p>Last night at the <a href = "http://www.harrisburgjug.org/">Harrisburg JUG</a> meeting, <a href = "http://www.petmystone.com/">Tim Stone</a> presented his development copy of the JUG blog preview based on <a href = "http://blojsom.sf.net/">Blojsom</a>.</p>
<p>Blojsom is very easy to install and get running, since it's file-backed by default.  I got an instance running in my JBoss (well, Tomcat was only needed) instance in about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I don't much care for the file-backed storage though.  It just feels like a scalability/synchronization problem.  All the storage backend is abstracted behind a fetcher inteface, though, so I could really be tempted to create a fetcher to get data from the EJBs that run my current weblog.</p>
<p>As I've said in the past, I'd start working to extend these other blog packages, if I wasn't using mine to learn all these technologies.  I could, on the other hand, start using Blojsom or Roller for my weblog, and pick up another project to learn Struts.</p>
