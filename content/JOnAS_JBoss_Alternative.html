<p><a href = "http://jonas.objectweb.org/">JOnAS 4.1</a> has been released and looks pretty advanced by the descriptions -- J2EE 1.4 support.  I've also been curious about Tomcat 5, which it has integrated already.  JBoss is getting a little stale in these areas, but it <i>is</i> working.</p>
<p>I don't even know if XDoclet has support for it, but it may be interesting to download it and see how it performs in relation to the JBoss 3.2.3 server I usually use.</p>
<p>I got it running pretty quickly.  It's memory footprint looks similar to JBoss.  The web console looks very nice at first glance -- actual monitoring with updating graphs, etc.  I haven't figured out how to deploy to it yet, and my enthusiasm has slipped as I'm faced with figuring out how to create new message queues and data sources.  I generally like to do this for myself in the config files, but maybe I'll have to take a serious look at the console.  It's really not that big of a deal to type the stuff interactively as opposed to copying or cutting and pasting config files.</p>
