<p>I was pleased to see the other day that my current version of mplayer (from <a href = "ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/">Marillat's Debian Archive</a>) now supports 3gp video <em>with</em> audio.  Previously, I could see the video, but not here any audio.  This is the video format recorded by our camera phones.</p>
<p>This renewed my interest in getting the little videos off of our phones and published to the <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/">gallery</a>.  I had to patch gallery's <code>util.php</code> to teach it that 3gp is indeed a valid video format.  After patching, it immediately recognized the videos for upload.</p>
<p>My next step will be figuring out how to transcode the 3gp files into something a bit more common, like mpeg.</p>
