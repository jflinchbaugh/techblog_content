<p>On Saturday night, Claire and  I actually got to go out to <a href = "http://www.kidzthatgroove.com/fliershtml/2004/jerramey/breakloose.htm">Break Loose</a> at York's Waterway Raw Bar and Grill.  It was a nice venue -- plenty of room in 3 separate areas.  I've been out of the scene mostly, so all the music seemed pretty new to me.  Since I'm a huge dnb head, and there was none of that here, I wasn't compelled to dance myself to extreme exhaustion.</p>
<p>It looks like <a href = "http://www.ultraworld.net/">Ultraworld</a> has Starscape 2004 coming up in July.  <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/showArticle.java?id=35">Last year's</a> was worthwhile, so maybe I'll try to get to this one as well.</p>
