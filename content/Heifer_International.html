<p>For 60 years, <a href = "http://www.heifer.org/">Heifer International</a> has been providing a way for people to provide useful farm animals directly to families who need them in needy areas around the world.  They not only provide the animals, but also support and training to families who need help learning to care for the animal and produce food and a living.</p>
<p>It's a program that makes pretty basic sense, so it will definitely be on my Christmas wishlist for next year.  I'll be encouraging gift-givers to send someone a cow or something in my name. :)</p>
<p>If you're especially well-off and looking to give $5000, check out all you could send in the <a href = "http://catalog.heifer.org/giftark.cfm">Ark Package</a>.  It's just amazing how far money can go when applied properly!</p>
