<p>Comcast is trying to clean up spam coming from their networks without the blanket tactics of blocking all outgoing port 25 connections.  Instead, they're looking to <a href = "http://news.com.com/Attack+of+Comcast's+Internet+zombies/2010-1034_3-5218178.html">just block it at individual cablemodems</a>.  I'm not a virused up spam-zombie, so I should stay open.  Comcast continues to do well by me -- they don't suck.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I still need to send most my mail through their mail servers, since some hosts out there are blocking anything coming from Comcast's dynamic IP range.  It's nice I can at least make the exceptions when I want, though.</p>
