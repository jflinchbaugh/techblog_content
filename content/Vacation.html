<p>I'm actually off on vacation this week.  I'm in Sea Isle City, NJ dangling at the end of a Bluetooth/GPRS connection -- quite useful, really.</p>
<p>Claire and Paige plan to hit the beach a good bit, and I plan to read, code, and relax a bit.</p>

<p>I got off to a slow start, but I'm doing pretty well now.  I'm ripping through blog code applying appropriate patterns where possible and adding management screens for an admin to customize the weblog without having to change the JSP or poking at the underlying database.  This includes new lists to just view comments independent of articles, management of the referer blacklist, and finally configuring the left-side link panes -- that's all hardcoded at this point.</p>
