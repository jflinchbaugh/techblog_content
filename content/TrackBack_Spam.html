<p>TrackBack spam has been unbelievable over the past week.  I think I need to repurpose my Referrer Blacklist to serve as a blacklist for any 3rd-party content on this site: referrers, comments, or trackbacks.  I guess I'll be back struggling to get XDoclet behaving under Eclipse again so I can actually write and deploy some new weblog code.</p>
<p><strong>Update (5:00pm):</strong>
I've poked around a bit and added the ability to run comments (which are the underlying representation of my trackbacks) through the existing Referrer Blacklist.  I don't do the callback, since I can't necessarily expect the URL to point to a page with a link back to me.  The callback works really well for referrers though.  Now we'll see how well this works.</p>
