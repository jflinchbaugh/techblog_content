<p>Someone on the <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/groups/365610@N21/">non-metering lens</a> Flickr group asked for notes on switching from a D40 to a D90, and given the non-metering context, I felt particularly qualified to <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/groups/365610@N21/discuss/72157622788605551/#comment72157622794763381">answer</a>.  Here's a copy of my response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I switched to the D90 a week ago after my beloved D40 went into a creek.
I've found with all my ME/MF experience of my old prime lenses, I could pick up the new body pretty quickly.  The extra buttons are nice to have, but many of those added buttons are useless too -- metering modes, focus modes, etc.</p>

<p>I chose the D90 over the D5000 for the better viewfinder, though it still only has the green focusing dot , upon which I continue to rely. The D90 viewfinder *is* pretty big and bright, so I expect it *is* helping me focus a bit. I did see some missed focus that surprised me in my first day out with the camera, but I seem to have adjusted by now -- I'm not sure what was going on there. It may have been the switch to my backup 50mm Series E which caused it -- my first one went in the creek the previous week.</p>
<p>Chimping on the new LCD led me to under-expose my photos quite a bit initially, because the display was so bright. Once I backed down the display brightness, and started to use the nicer histogram displays on the big D90 screen, I was exposing well again.</p>
<p>I did stumble upon one non-AI Nikon lens that I have laying around which I can't mount -- a 55mm micro.  I had never really used it with my D40 either.</p>
<p>I ended up using the same raw processing software (rawstudio on Linux) and even the same camera profile I used with my D40, and the look of my photos is the same as with the D40.</p>
<p>Photo processing is a bit slower having to work with twice as many pixels, but the good news is that I'm finding I have to run noise reduction much less frequently!  ISO 800 is looking quite nice.</p>
<p>Check my <a href = "http://flickr.com/photos/jflinchbaugh/">photostream</a>, and you may not be able to quickly notice the switch to the D90.</p>
<p>My only reservation has been giving up the D40's faster flash sync at 1/500 sec.  The D90 only does 1/200 sec, so I anticipate having to pump up my strobes a bit next time I shoot with them outdoors.</p>
