<p>I just love this stuff, so I thought I'd note that I've now optimized the display of search engine results in my referer list.  Links coming from Google or Yahoo! searches now are prefixed accordingly and show only the search string.  I've also added <i>title</i> attributes to the links, so you can see more of the link name in a mouse-over.</p>
