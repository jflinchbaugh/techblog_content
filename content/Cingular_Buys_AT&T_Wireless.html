<p>It seems that <a href = "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4283829/">Cingular won the bid for AT&T Wireless</a>.  I like my ATTWS service.  They have reasonable data service, and they have lots of slick phones for me to ogle.  I've not had to call customer service much, so I can't complain there too much either.  If all goes well, Cingular will keep AT&T's network and technology together, add their's into the mix, and shake up the plans and rates a  bit.  Expansion of the GSM network and some sweetened data rates could inspire me to replace our phones with some nice new GSM-only phones with all the bells and whistles, like MMS, cameras, PIM, etc.  I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>ATTWS' data rates are more expensive than T-Mobile, but with my dual-mode phone, I have better overall coverage.  I can switch to TDMA when the GSM network is missing.  They've already built out enough new GSM to tempt me to give up TDMA, and I hope adding Cingular's network and universal roaming on T-Mobile, etc will give me good reason to renew my contract and get a new phone.</p>
<p>Of course, this could just be me being dim and not seeing how this is going to screw me in the end.  The last time my provider got bought out, I ended up ultimately switching away to AT&T.  PCS One had SMS/email and free mobile-to-mobile that I liked.  When Voicestream bought them, they did away with the free air and broke email for months on end.  T-Mobile seems to have served the old PCS One customers much better after buying up Voicestream.</p>
