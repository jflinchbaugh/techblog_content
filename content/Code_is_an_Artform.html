<p>Code really is an artform as much as it is a science.  Code can be elegant and beautiful, so please remember this the next time you're tempted to <b><i>completely mangle</i></b> it with your favorite editor's cut-n-paste function or whatever.</p>
<p>Pretty code also serves to be more readable and <b>maintainable</b>.</p>
<p>Using an editor (vi) that requires me to think a moment before mangling has made me a better programmer, and the desire to keep any and all code in its finest form has also lead me away from inferior code-generating tools.  I'll only use generators (like Xdoclet in particular) that are elegant enough to allow me to control everything from <i>my</i> source.  Xdoclet is usable, because I never have to try modify and maintain generated code -- I can go right back to my source.</p>
