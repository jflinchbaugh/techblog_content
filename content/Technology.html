<p>This blog uses a bunch of J2EE stuff -- It's an exercise of my abilities with these technologies.</p>
Entity beans persist the data.  Session beans implement the business logic.  Navigation and control is implemented (somewhat poorly at this point) in Jakarta Struts.  JSP provides the view.
As usual, my project is overengineered and scalable to 10000 users across 3 servers, when the need arises. :)
