<p>I love the new software rat race for some reason, so I was all excited to see <a href = "http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download-2_5.html">WTK 2.5</a> was released.  It's only for WinXP at this point, though, so I'll be  watching for the Linux one.  I hope it won't be too long, since my Linux notebook is my only mobile development platform.  I've been using WTK 2.2 for the longest time.</p>
<p><strong>Update (13 April 2007):</strong> I see that Sun has an early access version of <a href = "http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download-2_5_1.html">WTK 2.5.1</a> available for Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Update (16 April 2007):</strong> Thank's to an explanation at <a href = "http://gnu.wildebeest.org/diary-man-di/?p=36">man-di's weblog</a>, I see that it's built against a newer version of GLIBC (2.4 I guess), so the emulator doesn't want to run on my Debian unstable box.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I just did an update of Debian and found that GLIBC 2.5 just hit the unstable tree.  Awesome!  I'm up and running now.</p>
