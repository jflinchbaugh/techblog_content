<p>Bush has <a href = "http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20040601/ap_on_el_pr/bush_faith_based_1">renewed his push to fund faith-based organizations</a> to help the less fortunate.  Way back when this first came up I very liberally thought to myself, "Sure, if they want to do the job, fine," but these days I don't support it.  At every step, Bush is trying to erase the lines between religion and government annd hand this country to the religious right.  This is just another step, and he must be stopped.  They can do the job with their own money, or we can come up with our own social programs without relying on faith groups as a crutch.</p>
<p>Letting the government fund faith groups is just too gray.  I can't see how the faith groups could actually take the money in realiity, because it would come with an expectation of equal treatment, employment, etc of people their group probably condemns and would otherwise discriminate.</p>
