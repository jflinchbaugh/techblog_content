<p>The Department of Homeland Security says we should <a href = "http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=74&e=3&u=/cmp/20040702/tc_cmp/22103407">stop using MSIE</a>. (Ugh, they've absorbed CERT?!  hmmm, but that's another story, I guess.)</p>
<p>I happen to agree this time, but I'm still awaiting the end of the world that's been promised every holiday weekend since September of 2001 or since 1 January 2000 for that matter.  I definitely have a morbid curiosity about how bad the world can get because of people using IE.  I wouldn't even bother with the big fat "You were warned!" that could be due.  I'd just smile and walk to where ever I need (because the gas pumps will be shutdown in all the chaos).</p>
