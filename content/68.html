<p>I saw this random comment on a <a href = "http://slashdot.org/articles/03/11/20/148246.shtml?tid=159&tid=186&tid=98&tid=99">Slashdot story</a>, and I think my Christmas list just got a little shorter.  I'll just be happy with the abundance of good fortune I already have:</p>

I'm pretty much a gadget geek. Here are some of the things that I want for Christmas:<br/>
<br/>
1) Job, so that I can buy these things for myself. Being laid off sucks.<br/>
2) Something for my daughter, besides the bare necessities.<br/>
3) Something for my wife. She works hard because I'm laid off.<br/>
4) December's mortgage payment.<br/>
5) November's property tax payment.<br/>
6) One night of uninterrupted sleep.<br/>
7) A two-month contract, just enough to get through December<br/>
8) A month contract, just enough to get through November.<br/>
9) A week contract, just enough to pay my phone and electric bill.<br/>
10) All the above for my friend, who's worse off than I am.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped dreaming about dual Opterons about six months ago.
