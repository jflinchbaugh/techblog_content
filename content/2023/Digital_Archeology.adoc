== Nostalgia for Old Code

I've been coding for a very long time,
so I've had lots of projects
in various languages,
on various platforms,
and stored very differently.

I got nostalgic
on and off
over the past couple years
and went digging around
to recover
the source
for some of those old projects.
I uploaded the more notable projects
to my https://github.com/jflinchbaugh[GitHub account].

== Old Floppies

I spent money to buy a 3.5-inch USB floppy drive
and an old 386 PC
with a 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch floppy drive,
so I could ultimately copy files
from really old 5.25-inch floppies
that I used
in the late 1980s
and early 1990s
to my live storage
of today.
Among those old files
were binaries and source
in GWBASIC and QuickBasic.

== QuickBasic

I found one of the first games I wrote
and sort of distributed,
https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/gravity-blocks[Gravity Blocks].
I could play the compiled binary
with https://www.dosbox.com/[DOSBox]
and read the main source file,
but some of the source code
for my common libraries
is still locked up in a compressed format
from QuickBasic 4.5.
I may need to dig deeper into
https://github.com/QB64Official/qb64[QB64],
a clone of QuickBasic 4.5
that seems to be able
to read, run, and compile
those old compressed files.

== GWBASIC

I also found source code
for the first software
I wrote for the local fire company
to help track statistics on calls
and print reports
to submit
to the local municipalities
we served.

It was written in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC[GWBASIC],
so I was able
to https://github.com/danvk/gwbasic-decoder[decode]
the compressed source
where needed to read it.
I published my
https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/call-rep-1992[CALL-REP source],
so I could go back
and have a look
at the simple,
but useful,
things I used to write
as a kid.

== Copies of Old Servers and Subversion

I continued
to build stuff
through college
(and obviously beyond).
Some of it was in C, PERL, and Java.

I recovered these bits
of source code
laying around in backups and copies
of old Linux servers I've run
over the years.
This source was in old Subversion repositories
that used old versions of Berkeley DB.
Initially,
This BDB version mismatch
kept `svn checkout` from working,
but the current Subversion tools
have an `svnadmin recover` command
that could fix the repository
for normal reading today.
I'm sure some
of those old SVN repositories
had previously been migrated
from CVS.

== Java

I found the source code
from my final project
in the Java class
in my last year of college
in 2000.

https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/bust[Pop-a-Prof]
is a clone of my favorite puzzle game,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Bobble[Bust-a-Move].
It's a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet[Java Applet]
that ran in Netscape
allowing any number of players,
and it coordinated everyone's play
with a shared public server,
Each round lasted 5 minutes,
and any time you topped-out,
you'd lose some points,
and start over,
so no one needed to sit around watching
the last people battle it out.

After school,
I started on
https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/pop-a-prof-2[Pop-a-Prof 2].
This one ran as a plain Java application,
and implemented rebounding balls
in the game.
It was more of a proof-of-concept
for the new game mechanics,
and it never got network play.

== Java ME

I liked running little bits of code,
like applets did,
so I continued
into writing
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition[Java ME (J2ME)]
for my
https://www.hjsoft.com/blog/2020/Past_Phones.html[feature phones]
around 2005.

I did a gas-logging app
that stored fuel-ups
and drew graphs to show fuel economy.

I also wrote
a quick little
game called https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/BensBackhoe[Ben's Backhoe]
to give the kids
a little something
to do on my phone.
By the time
I was building this sort
of thing,
though,
I'm a decent Java programmer,
so it's not the fun mess
that we see in the other old project.

== Still More

I spent most the day
poking around
at various old BASIC files
and trying to tweak them
a bit to run
in https://robhagemans.github.io/pcbasic/[PCBasic]
or https://github.com/QB64Official/qb64[QB64].
I used lots of weird graphics modes
from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000[Tandy 1000]
and didn't think much about portability.
I may post more projects over time.
