I have https://www.smartthings.com/[Samsung SmartThings]
automatically setting the thermostat
and turning things on and off
for me
based on the location
of my phone (and me).

Of course,
it stopped working,
so I needed to debug.
All the other things connected
to the hub were working fine.

== Things That Didn't Fix It

* Restart my phone
* Wipe the SmartThings app data on my phone and login again
* Restart the SmartThings Hub
* Check app permissions on the phone:
  no optimization, fine location access always on.

== The Fix

. Open SmartThings app on the phone
. Menu
. Settings Cog
. Get your location from this phone
. Turn it off, then back on
. Visit my 2 location-based triggers
  and re-add myself as a member.
. Fixed!
