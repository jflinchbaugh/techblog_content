tells the history
of a piece
of educational software,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO_(computer_system)[PLATO],
that grew
into a whole microcosm
of the internet
and cyber culture
years before the internet
we've known for the past 25 years.

Brian Dear attributes
the obscurity
of PLATO to it having been
built and developed
at University of Illinois
in the Midwest and not
at a school on the coast.
The PLATO system also used
dedicated client hardware
with integrated slide projectors,
and it ran on a single mainframe.
Everything was coded
in a programming language
called TUTOR,
which was primarily designed
for authoring interactive lessons
using the orange gas plasma display,
a rudimentary touch input for the screen,
the keyboard,
an slide projector integrated into the display,
and even occasional peripherals
like some sort of synthetic woodwind sound device.
It was all very specialized
from the beginning.

I loved the time the author dedicated
to describing technical details,
like how the orange
gas plasma display was developed:
the grids of wiring,
pockets of noble gasses
trapped between them,
and the way accidental
contamination allowed them
to discover a memory effect
they could use to keep
each pixel lit.
Fixing the contamination
lost the memory effect.
He presented a wonderful
level of detail
for my interest.

== Cyber Culture

Donald Bitzer
showed off PLATO
to anyone who would
take a moment to try it.
He wanted people to learn
and get creative,
seldom shutting down experiments.
He'd embrace the high school
and university hackers
who would wander into the labs,
and he put some of them to work
building hardware or testing.
These people would go on
to build all sorts of multiplayer games
and other software to be used
by other users on the system.
Bitzer recognized the value
in observing what people
did with the spare cycles
of the system
at night.
From that freedom
sprung an entire hacker culture
similar to what I found in my youth,
so I felt great nostalgia for this work.
Again though,
I was discovering
this culture in the 1990s
with bulletin board systems
and the internet
in college,
and Bitzer's revolution
had already happened
in the 1970s.
We were always
pushing the limits
of what we were supposed
to do with these systems.
It looked like wasted time,
but we learned the most.

Discovering new lessons
or software
on the PLATO system
seemed akin
to our exploration of BBSes
via our modems in the 1990s.
We'd stumble around trying
to find some new phone number
or new corner of an existing BBS,
and these kids in the 1970s
were exploring PLATO
to find games
or long threaded discussions
in notes that others
were developing.

PLATO started
as a way to display some slides
and teach a self-paced lesson,
but grew into games,
forums, and email
before such things existed.
It could have grown into one
of the great online services
that followed,
but they may have gotten
too tied up in their centralization
and specialized hardware.
The management
of their commercial partner
may not have helped either,
because they just wanted
to sell mainframes,
and didn't recognize the value of community
that had been built around the system.

The book was an exciting listen,
and I blasted
through the whole thing
in about 2 days,
because I just couldn't put it down.
It reminded me of my childhood
and the all the potential
of the systems of the day
and the creativity that came
from the limitations
of the day.
PLATO evolved
in an alternate universe
in the middle of the country
away from the technology hubs.
