<p>If you have a <a href = "http://www.google.com/maps?f=l&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22batteries+plus%22&amp;near=york,+pa">Batteries Plus</a> near you, it's a good place to look for a variety of batteries you'd usually assume could only be found at Radio Shack.  I was surprised to see lots of the little button cells which I need for a variety of devices, like Photon Lights.  I believe many cost less than the "one price for any cell (whether you usually need 1 or 4 at a time)" garbage Radio Shack has been pulling.</p>
<p>Additionally, they conveniently repacked an odd cordless phone battery for me when no Radio Shack could find a replacement to order from their catalog.  That's a pretty useful service, and it cost me about the same as a replacement battery, had I been able to find one.</p>
