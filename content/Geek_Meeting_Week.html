<p>This is <em>Geek Meeting Week</em> for me.  The <a href = "http://www.harrisburgjug.org/">Harrisburg JUG</a> (with Bill Kratzer's excellent presentation on <a href = "http://www.harrisburgjug.org/display/JUG/2007-02-20+Game+Development+in+Java">Game Programming in Java</a>).meeting got pushed from last Thursday up to this Tuesday, and the first monthly <a href = "http://agileharrisburg.pbwiki.com/">Agile Harrisburg</a> kicks off tonight.</p>
