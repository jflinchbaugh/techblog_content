<p>I've been hearing about these little micro-blog/location applications for a while, so when I heard about them yet again on <a href = "http://www.twit.tv/natn11">net@nite</a>, I figured I should take a look.  They specifically mentioned <a href = "http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href = "http://www.groovr.com/">Groovr</a>.  Groovr's ability to take photos and location intrigued me, so I created  <a href = "http://www.groovr.com/user/jflinchbaugh/">my own account</a>.</p>
<p>I've been interested in building this sort of thing for my own use, so maybe I'll find this useful.  I must say that I was pleased to see Groovr happily accepted my mobile email address instead of insisting upon sending me SMS messages directly.  This allows me to interact with it using my flat-rate data plan, instead of chewing through my SMS and MMS plan.  At a glance, it seems that the service may only be a month or 2 old, so I expect they'll add lots more interesting features.  It may also be that the new website is only a couple months old too.  I'm not sure.</p>
