<p>Outlook, Entourage, and Evolution have trained me in work environments to <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style">top-post</a> my email replies against my curmudgeonly better judgment.</p>
<p>Now that I'm mostly job searching and sending <em>lots</em> of email from my home account, I've finally buckled to the peer pressure, and configured <code>mutt</code> to top-post my signature in the <code>.muttrc</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<code>set sig_on_top = yes</code></blockquote>
<p>I don't even frequent those old mailing lists where someone would yell at me for top-posting, anyway. Next I'll likely just dump Mutt and go to a desktop mail client, like Thunderbird.</p>
