<p>Mr Perez over at <a href = "http://www.manageability.org/news">Manageability</a> has a nice little <a href = "http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/temporal_anomolies">entry</a> about a <a href = "http://www.mjyoung.net/time/index.htm">site</a> examining time travel in movies.  It's an interesting read.  I was particularly interested in his thoughts on one of our favorite movies, "12 Monkeys".</p>
