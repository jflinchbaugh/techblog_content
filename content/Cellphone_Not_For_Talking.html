<p><a href = "http://www.marketplace.org/">MarketPlace</a> had a little article on Friday about people wanting to do <a href = "http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2005/02/11/PM200502112.html">more from their cell phones than just talk</a>.</p>
<p>The phone providers may finally be getting serious about pushing for higher bandwidth (for streaming audio and video), more powerful phones, and providing more useful content suitable for small devices.  They're resorting to advancing technology, since they can no longer differentiate themselves by price.</p>
<p>I think we've been seeing the ground work being laid for this for a bit, but it still only exists mostly in the niche technophile market.  Once the rest of the United States latches onto high-resolution, high color screens, Java, next-generation networking, maybe we'll see even quicker advances in this technology.</p>
<p>As with the computer industry, I look forward to the masses pushing the industry with games, toys, and media consumption, and I'll use it for applications and information services.</p>
