<p>When I saw Linux 2.6.12-rc4 was looking nearly pristine on my notebook, I declared that I'll finally reboot and upgrade the kernel on my server when 2.6.12 comes out.  Well, that was nearly a month ago, and I'm still waiting.</p>
<p>I'm up to Linux 2.6.12-rc6 on my notebook, and I've heard faint rumblings that 2.6.12 may be out within the next week.  My server's been up for over 278 days, and I have 2 new cards and a kernel to install whenever that kernel becomes available.  It's funny how you can't find a good excuse to reboot some days, and then other days, you can't keep the machine running at all.</p>
