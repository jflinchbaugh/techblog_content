<p>Everyone loves Pixar's Toy Story movies, right, so go check out <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/groups/secretlifeoftoys/">The Secret Life of Toys</a> on <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Toys from all over the world show up there, and some will send you on interesting chases around Google trying to figure out what they are and from where they came, like <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/photos/djcopeman/3246845785/">cardboard box robots</a> and <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/photos/renaissance/481658704/">odd designer dolls</a>.  Other figures will be more recognizable, like <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/photos/jflinchbaugh/3722666113/in/pool-secretlifeoftoys">Little People</a>, <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/photos/seven13avenue/2469925212/">Stormtroopers</a>, and <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/photos/balakov/3317358958/">Lego people</a>.</p>
<p>There are so many beautiful images and interesting stories that I'm sure you'll start getting ideas of what your own toys may do while you're not watching. You'll likely find a toy or 2 of mine there as well. This is becoming one of my primary photography styles, since it's so much fun.</p>
