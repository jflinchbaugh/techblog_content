<p>I've fallen back into a bit of light gear-acquisition mode over the past week.</p>

<p>After my photo class on Tuesday, we were discussing the inverse square law of light and practical application of it, and we determined that given 2 light sources of the same power, you know that you can vary the distances to the subject by familiar distances to get a predictable difference in lighting.  Specifically, place one light at 5.6 feet and the other at 8 feet, and you should have a 1-stop difference.</p>
<p>I obviously need a second light of the same power as my first to play this out, so I hit eBay and ordered another Sunpak 422D to match my first one.  I couldn't figure out which radio triggers would be compatible with the ones I have, so I decided to just order an optical slave to trigger the new flash.  I may still end up buying another set of radio triggers, because it'll be fun to be able to share when playing with friends.  A second cheap light isn't so bad.</p>
<p>I'll need an umbrella and clamp for that new flash, so I figure maybe I'll hit B&amp;H or another camera store when I'm in New York this weekend and pick up these things.</p>
<p>Then I went out to the museums this weekend, and tried to shoot available light indoors with my kit 18-55mm lens.  I ended up on ISO 1600 before I knew it, so I made a lot of work for myself in post processing to clean that up.  I ended up with throwing away many shots.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about replacing my kit lens with some f/2.8 lens in the same range, but they're incredibly expensive.  I decided to throw a few bids out there to buy the 28mm f/2.8 sister to my 50mm f/1.8 lens.  I love my 50mm, but it's a little close when I want to get more in frame than a head shot.  I think I'll find the 28mm useful.</p>
<p>I guess the alternative to buying faster lenses is to work harder to <em>light</em> with my 2 flashes (3 counting the dumb little slave), but I don't run-and-gun too much anymore, since most my lenses are manual (requiring 2 hands), and the kids keep my hands full otherwise.</p>
<p>In my <em>unsuccessful</em> spending ventures, I was going to build a backdrop, but I did not manage to find any suitable material at the local fabric store.  They didn't have anything wide enough, so I came back empty handed there.</p>
<p>Claire will be pleased, I'm sure, to see that I'm expanding into using my gadget bag in addition to my normal camera bag. ;)</p>
