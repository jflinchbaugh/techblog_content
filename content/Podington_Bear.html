<p>Yesterday, <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3&amp;prgDate=19-Apr-07">Morning Edition</a> ended their show with mention of artists writing, recording, producing, and distributing music <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9666926">nearly daily</a> as podcasts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I've now discovered <a href = "http://www.podingtonbear.com/">Podington Bear</a>.  He's producing great little upbeat electronic tracks and remixes at a rate of 3 per week.  It sounds great so far.</p>
