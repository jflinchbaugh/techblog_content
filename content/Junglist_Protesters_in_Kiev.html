<p>NPR's been reporting from Kiev, Ukraine where supporters of the opposition party are <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4184498">protesting</a> the latest flawed election.  The reporter seems close the the action, so every report features lots of almost overwhelming noise from the crowd in the background -- the first report I had heard had people chanting political slogans, and this latest one had a nice little DnB track blasting over the PA system.</p>
