<p>I posted <a href = "http://forums.cingular.com/cng/board/message?board.id=sonyericsson&amp;message.id=15589">this message</a> to the SonyEricsson forum at Cingular:</p>

<p>I'm in the process of writing a Java app for my phone, and I've also been trying to run a few free programs, such as midpSSH and GooglME. My S710a is giving me SecurityExceptions when these programs try to access network sockets or even send SMS.</p>
<p>I've come to understand that Cingular may have disabled access to these capabilities for unsigned java apps.</p>
<p>How can I bypass this security, so I can run my programs?</p>
<p>How can I install my own certificate authority, so I can sign my own midlets?</p>
<p>Or what's the cheapest way to get my apps signed? What about these other 3rd-party apps I'd like to use?</p>
<p>I upgraded from my T616 to get a socket implementation in J2ME, and in the process, I still can't access sockets and I've LOST access to SMS (for GooglME). I find this HIGHLY disappointing, and I'm really beginning to regret the purchase of this otherwise great phone.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to try getting it unlocked and unbranded just to see if it'll make those security restrictions go away.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any experiences, ideas, or leads on how to overcome this issue? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hopefully, someone will be able to help me out and make me happier to own this phone.</p>
<p>I've been reading <a href = "http://www.spindriftpages.net/pebble/dave/2005/06/20/1119275880301.html">elsewhere about signing MIDlets</a>, and there seems to be many people who need to be able to do this.  Are these security configurations really the norm these days?  I'll have to go poking around <a href = "http://developer.cingular.com/developer/index.jhtml">Cingular's Developer site</a> to see if I can learn an acceptable way to code and deploy fully functional J2ME applications.</p>
