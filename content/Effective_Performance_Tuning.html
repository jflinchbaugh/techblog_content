<p>I went to <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Tweaking_JBoss_Again">all that trouble</a> trying to tune out my JBoss server without much positive effect.  Trac had started to sort of put the squeeze on memory, and all the JBoss tuning in the world wasn't going to get Trac working better, so I just did the easy thing, and upgraded the server to 288M of RAM.  Now everything's flying!</p>
