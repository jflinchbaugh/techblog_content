<p>I took 388 photos on the combined photowalk 2 Sundays ago (20 April 2008), but managed to pare the offerings down to <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Photography/2008-04-20_Shenks_Ferry/">38 images</a>.  I processed all the images in RawStudio 1.0 and Gimp 2.4.</p>

<p>I met up with Virginia and Al from the No Fear Photography group and hung out with them for the trip.  I cycled through all my lenses as I did on previous trips -- 18-55mm, 55-200mm, and my 50mm prime.</p>
<p>When we got to the tunnel at the end of the trail, all 3 of us broke out our strobes and started playing.  Al had a shiny new SB-26 and a set of radio triggers.  We served as his voice activated light stands for a bit, and I played with my new SunPak 422D on its hot shoe cable.  I think I captured some worthwhile images, but I'm most happy with my strobe photos -- I was able to produce some interesting shadows and darken down the mood of some of the photos.</p>
