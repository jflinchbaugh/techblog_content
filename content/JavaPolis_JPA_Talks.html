<p>I had previously noted that I'd definitely be revisiting <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Neal_Gafter_on_Closures">Neal Gafter's talk on closures</a> for a second listen.  Right along side that podcast in my player were 2 others on the Java Persistence API: <a href = "http://www.bejug.org/confluenceBeJUG/display/PARLEYS/Using+the+Java+Persistence+API">Using JPA (Part 1)</a> and <a href = "http://www.bejug.org/confluenceBeJUG/display/PARLEYS/Enterprise++Development+with+JPA">Enterprise Development with JPA (Part 2)</a> featuring 2 spec leads from Oracle and BEA.  These 2 talks are awesome primers to what JPA can do, and I look forward to looking for further information and applying it.</p>
<p>I'll hopefully be headed to a <a href = "http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff Conference</a> this Spring.  I'll be lucky if the conference is half as informative as these JavaPolis presentations.  I expect NFJS will not disappoint.</p>
