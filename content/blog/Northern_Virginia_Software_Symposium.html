<p>My employer has agreed to send me to the <a href = "http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_agenda.jsp?showId=76&amp;byRoom=false">Northern Virginia Software Symposium</a> of the No Fluff Just Stuff series.  There are lots of great topics and speakers, so I'm quite excited.  I've already mapped out all the sessions I want to hit, and there were quite a few tough choices.  I'll be bouncing around talks on Enterprise Java, Agile, Testing, and Spring talks.  I expect to be completely overwhelmed for 2 and a half days.  It should be great!</p>
