<p>Thursday night TV was rather disappointing.  Everything was re-runs.  Scrubs was really odd.  JD realizes that the <a href = "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0283568/">janitor guy (Neil Flynn)</a> used to be an actor before a janitor.  He had a higher ambition -- something with which JD could relate.  He recognizes him in the movie, <a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106977/">The Fugitive</a>.</p>
<p>The really odd thing is that Neil Flynn <b>really</b> is the transit cop in The Fugitive.  I wasn't paying close attention to the segment of The Fugitive that they played, so I had to look it up on <a href = "http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>.  Plot-wise, I doubt it is significant, but it's still an odd twist in "show reality", and I don't recall seeing anything like that done in other shows.</p>
