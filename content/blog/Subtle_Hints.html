<p>My work email server went down today (yay, exchange!), and when it supposedly came back, I still could not connect.</p>
<p>It seems someone told the email guys that I was off the project, so they deleted me.  In reality, I'm no longer a consultant on this project, but I <b>am</b> now a staff member on this project.</p>
<p>Someone's trying to fire me already! ;)  Who says being a state employee is a stable job?</p>
