<p>With Monday off, I figured I'd catch up on computer work -- photo, video editing, some code, etc.  Just 2 hours ago, I added to my list rebuilding Claire's laptop from the ground up.</p>
<p>I was trying to get Windows to see the free spots on the hard drive, but it was having trouble, so I successfully moved the entire Linux filesystem to hda7, booted it, all that.  Then I went removing and recreating partitions.  It seems I can't just remove  hda7 and recreate hda3 in the exact same location and expect to actually be able to still use it with its new name.  That's a disappointment, so now I'm installing Debian again via Knoppix 3.3.  I'm getting to be a real pro at this.</p>
<p>I have it all put back together now for the most part.  Since Claire only uses the machine as a x-terminal to run a remote session on butterfly, I haven't really needed to restore any of the old files on it.</p>
<p>I installed Windows XP on it, which rendered Linux unbootable as usual.  I booted the Knoppix CD, mounted the on-disk FS, chrooted a shell into that filesystem, but lilo kept telling me permission denied.  It turns out the Knoppix LiveCD mounts other filesystems with <i>nosuid</i>, and <i>nodev</i>, so I remounted it with <i>suid</i> and <i>dev</i>, and lilo worked again, and I could restore the boot record properly.  Along the way, I also started using Knoppix 3.6 for this restoration.</p>
