<p><a href = "http://insanity.lost-angel.com/">Stacey</a> recently <a href = "http://insanity.lost-angel.com/blog/archives/000404.php">cleaned up her site</a> with lots of nice CSS stuff, and she managed to do it much better than I had.  Having studied her code a bit, I've implemented some of the same methods, and I eliminated some ugly javascript hacks to deal with page length.</p>
<p>All 3 sections of the page are now absolutely placed, which was the key to getting the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> to expand to hold it all in IE.</p>
<p>I've also implemented cookies for comment info, extended refer display, fixed sidebar size, etc.</p>
<p>I'm l33t like Stacey.</p>
