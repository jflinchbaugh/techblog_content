<p>Since I'm starting the Java EE side of a new personal project, I figured I'd catch up on technology a bit and have a look at EJB 3.  I installed JBoss 4.0.4RC1 using the installer to get EJB 3 support installed.  The installer was all messed up on my Linux desktop -- mostly failing to repainting itself, but whatever.</p>
<p>So far, I like using the new annotations to hook everything together, since I had been using xDoclet for everything previously.  Now I have much less to setup in my build environment to make it work.  I'm using <a href = "http://del.icio.us/jflinchbaugh/j2ee">some of these links</a> to get started.  I really like the new persistence API so far, though manipulating collections seems a bit tricky.</p>
