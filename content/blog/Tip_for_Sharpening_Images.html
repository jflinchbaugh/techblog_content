<p><a href = "http://photodoto.com/">Photodoto</a> has a <a href = "http://photodoto.com/index.php/2007/01/15/quick-photo-sharpening-tip/">quick photo sharpening tip</a> that I'm finding really useful in Gimp and surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>I now take these steps (optionally):</p>
<ol>
<li>Curves to correct exposure and color.</li>
<li>Crop with fixed ratio (2:3 or 3:2) select.</li>
<li>Selective Gaussian Blur to smooth ISO noise.</li>
<li>Duplicate the layer.</li>
<li>Unsharp Mask the new layer.</li>
<li>Add a black (transparent) mask to the sharpened layer.</li>
<li>Use a large brush, and paint white (opacity) onto the mask in just the lines I really want sharpened, such as the face or hands, or generally , the subject of the photo.</li>
<li>Flatten.</li>
<li>Save.</li>
</ol>
<p>Am I missing any other tricks?  Not that I'm saying I need to spend even more time post-processing images.  Somehow, though, I <em>am</em> caught up on stills and video right now.</p>
