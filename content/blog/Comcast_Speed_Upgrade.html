<p>The cablemodem was offline yesterday afternoon.  I don't mind too much though, since I'm now pulling 3Mbps instead of the old 1.5Mbps.  Yeah!  Now if only they would upgrade the outgoing speed (256kbps).  It's not so that bad, really -- having recently gotten into producing a bit of digital video, I had expected the slow upload speed to be more painful than it is.</p>
