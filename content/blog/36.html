<p>I remembered there being an hjsoft.cn, so I was just poking around google today to find this link: <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.tk/">www.hjsoft.tk</a>.  They stole my old logo!  :) That's funny.  Their bandwidth is limited by Geocities, so poking at them much knocks them out for a bit.</p>
<p>Apparently, I've been busier than I thought, too!  Check out <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.cn/english/index.html">HJSoft.cn</a>.  I should try to sell them hjsoft.com!  Don't worry, I wouldn't do that.  Changing names would be a huge pain in the ass.</p>
<p>It's odd though that they don't show up on Google anywhere near the top though.  One would expect a commercial venture to be higher profile than a hobby.</p>
