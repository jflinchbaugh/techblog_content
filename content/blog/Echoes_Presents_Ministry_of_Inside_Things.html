<p>Claire and I managed to get out for a bit without the kids.  We ran to <a href = "http://www.whitakercenter.org/">Whitaker Center</a> to see <a href = "http://www.echoes.org/">Echoes</a> bring <a href = "http://members.bellatlantic.net/~chuckv/moit.html">Ministry of Inside Things</a> to the stage.  <a href = "http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Frontrow/4877/index.html">Orbital Decay</a> (please excuse the link to a terrible website) opened the show.</p>
<p>Both bands were (almost equally) good, though the music was very mellow, and each had their <em><a href = "http://www.pinkfloyd.co.uk/dsotm/content/setup.html">Dark Side of the Moon</a></em> moments, which is fine.  I enjoyed the show greatly, and we got to meet John Diliberto.</p>
<p>Having previously accompanied me to several raves over the years, Claire expected the music to be a bit faster.  There were quite a few songs that would build slowly, and there'd be a point where you expect the rest of a huge techno track to materialize (ala <a href = "http://www.loopz.co.uk/">Orbital</a>, which Claire and I have had the pleasure of experiencing a couple years ago), but then you realize that was the climax of the song and we're on our way back down.</p>
<p>After the show, we wandered out onto 2nd Street of Harrisburg to find the place crawling with people.  It reminded me a bit of South Street in Philadelphia.  It was great.  We'll have to try to get to Harrisburg more often.</p>
