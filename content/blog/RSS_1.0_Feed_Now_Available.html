<p>With the help of <a href = "http://www.churchillobjects.com/c/13005.html">RSS4J</a>, I have an RSS 1.0 feed now available for my main article list (the latest 10 articles).  Try it out and see if it actually works in your aggregator or whatever.  I expect I'll be able to improve it in the near future, including adding the ability to filter them by topic.</p>
