<p>According to <a href = "http://mobilecrunch.com">MobileCrunch</a>, it seems that Coca Cola will be using <a href = "http://mobilecrunch.com/2006/10/03/op3-hits-it-big-shotcodes-to-appear-on-40-million-bottles-of-sprite/">ShotCodes on some bottles</a>.  I'm sort of disappointed that they chose <a href = "http://www.shotcode.com/">ShotCode</a> when there are other attempts that make more sense to me.  It's all very marginal work, and boosting the right standard into the spotlight would help immensely.  I just don't feel that ShotCode is the right choice.</p>
<p>ShotCode was the first example I had seen of these 2D barcodes for use with mobile phones, and I was really impressed.  It's used for quick downloads from <a href = "http://www.getjar.com/">GetJar</a> using the camera on your phone to scan the ShotCode off the computer display.</p>
<p>My excitement quickly fell off when I saw that I couldn't openly create ShotCodes of my own.  They seem to be assigned and centrally mapped through shotcode.com, so it represents nothing more than a serial number.</p>
<p>As an alternative, <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Large-Scale_Real-World_Computer_Gaming">SemaCode was used by area/code gaming</a>.  SemaCode has a more open SDK, and it seems that they encode the URL or text into the 2D barcode -- I've seen the little application show me the target URL without having to connect to a lookup service, and I've used their Java-based tools to generate barcodes on my Linux box.  This obviously feels like the better solution.</p>
<p>I still hope to find the time to develop and setup my own "little" Geocache/SemaCode game in the style of what <a href = "http://playareacode.com/">area/code</a> does.</p>
