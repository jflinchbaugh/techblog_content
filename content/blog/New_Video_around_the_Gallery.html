<p>I found lots of raw video on my harddrive, so I finally sat down and editted and encoded it all.  I have a camera-full to do again after this.  You'll find the new clips here:
<ul>
<li><a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Paige_10_Months">Paige 10 Months</a></li>
<li><a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Paige_11_Months?page=5">Paige 11 Months</a></li>
<li><a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Deck?page=3">First Fire</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Kino seems to be getting pretty nice, so editting is much easier these days.</p>
