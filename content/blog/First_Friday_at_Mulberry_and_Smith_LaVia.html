<p>This First Friday, I have 2 places to be at once, so instead I'm splitting my night:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5pm&ndash;8pm:</strong> I'll be showing some fine-art work, framed and ready to buy at <a href = "http://www.mulberryartstudios.com/">Mulberry Art Studios</a> with the rest of the <a href = "http://www.lancastercameraclub.org/">Lancaster Camera Club</a>.</li>
<li><strong>8pm&ndash;whenever:</strong>I expect to head up to Smith LaVia (329 N Queen St) to shoot holiday images or whatever comes around and just hang out with friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, I'll see everyone at Mulberry and/or at Smith LaVia.  Lancaster City is a great place, and there's lots to see every First Friday.</p>
