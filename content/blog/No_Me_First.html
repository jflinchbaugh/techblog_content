<p>I go as long as possible between reboots of servers and even my notebook.  I've seen various configurations of hotplug and udev cross my Debian machines between reboots, so when I recently rebooted the server, I found my 3 network cards reordered, and hence mostly dysfunctional -- The network configs were trying to serve DHCP to the outside, find the cablemodem on the LAN, and the firewall was just completely backwards.  I had seen the same thing happen occassoinally on my notebook, but the stakes aren't as high there.</p>
<p>The modules for my NICs were automatically being loaded in varying orders by hotplug or udev, and that ordering directly affected the interface names they were assigned, so I needed to disable the automatic load of these modules.  Old hotplug allowed me to list them in <code>/etc/hotplug/blacklist.d/</code>, but that's no longer used by udev when it replaced hotplug in Debian.</p>
<p>After some reading in debian-user archives around the time they made this switch, I figured out that I could blacklist the modules in <code>/etc/modprobe.d/</code>.  At first glance, this seemed like a bad idea, because it could keep me from ever loading these modules.  In reality, the blacklist only disables loading the modules by an alias name.  If I load them with <code>modprobe</code> explicitly the blacklist is not applied and I will still be able to load the driver.  Listing the modules in <code>/etc/modules</code> works as well, so I can have them loaded there in the order I define, and the interfaces are always as I expect...until the next change, anyway.</p>
<p>Linux 2.6.14 is looking good now on my server and notebook.</p>
