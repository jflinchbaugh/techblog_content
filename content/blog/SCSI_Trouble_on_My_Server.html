<p>I got the good idea that I needed to mount up an extra 18G drive on my server to store music.  I knew the block length was set to 516 instead of the normal (and usable) 512, so I'd have to low-level format it.  I started at about 11:00pm and much trouble ensued.</p>
<p>I got curious in the SCSI BIOS and kicked off a low-level format in there.  This, of course, meant the box wasn't serving anything, and I had no idea how long it would take.  After 10 minutes, I got impatient, and killed it to see what Linux would do with it.  It was not pleased with me (MEDIUM ERROR), so I went back into the BIOS and did it again, but waited.</p>
<p>While I waited, I got impatient again regretting using the BIOS for this.  Instead of touching the server, I took out my impatience on the backup gentoo box, and formatted another drive using <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Backup_Space">my directions from the last time</a>.  I stayed the hell away from the BIOS this time, and just used <code>scu</code>.  Specifically, I did this:
<ol>
<li><code># scu -f /dev/sg0</code></li>
<li><code>scu&gt; set bypass on</code></li>
<li><code>scu&gt; set device block-length 512</code></li>
<li><code>scu&gt; time format defects primary options dcrt</code></li>
</ol>
About the time I got this started, the BIOS format on the server finished, so I could boot up, find that it didn't change the block length for me, and  then I kicked off the same scu process on the server.</p>
<p>I made file systems on it, mounted it up, but got disconnect and reset errors from my SCSI interface for that drive.  I rebooted, tried again, but had the same issue.  I ripped the case apart again and swapped in my other drive.  It's about 2:00AM by now.</p>
<p>That drive worked, so I copied 10G of music to it.  I left it at 3:00AM and continued a bit in the morning at 7:00AM.  I unmounted it, tried to remount it in a new place, and got the disconnect errors again.  I ripped open the case again, unplugged the drive from the adapter, booted the machine again and left it.</p>
<p>Having had a moment to think about it now, these drives work fine in my older server with the slower SCSI card.  That card tries to talk to them at something like 10Mb/s.  My card in the new server seemed to think it could talk 40Mb/s to the drive.  I have to wonder if I just need to tune the access speed down a bit to get it working reliably.  I'll have to try that tonight.</p>
<p>In the beginning of all this, when I rebooted, my computer seems to have decided it can release its IP to the DHCP server, so I got a new IP address after 1.5 years of having the same one.  My handy DNS update script worked fine, but the script that puts my IP in the /etc/hosts file and makes it available to my firewall scripts didn't work -- my firewall script used the old IP and pretty much locked up any outgoing traffic.  That took a moment to figure out, and I still don't have the script working properly.</p>
<p>I just wanted to collect all my music in one place instead of being distributed across several CDs and a laptop.  Ultimately, I hope to be able to just load up anything I want on my laptop and be good for a while.  When I get tired of it, just delete it and load it again.  The server will have the central repository.  I'm even toying with the idea of have a process to burn random mix CDs for in the car.  First, though, I must get this drive working.</p>
<p><b>Update (25 April 2004):</b> I bumped the speed in the SCSI BIOS down to 10Mb, just like the gentoo box, and now the drive is working fine.  It's been mounted up and functioning for over a day now with no incidents.  That's a relief.</p>
<p>For everyone's reference, here's the ID of the drive, in case someone else looks for this sort of information:
<pre>
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 03 Lun: 00
  Vendor: FUJITSU  Model: MAA3182SCX       Rev: 2412
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
</pre>
