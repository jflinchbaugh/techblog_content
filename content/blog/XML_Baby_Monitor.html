<p>I awoke this morning from a dream to Paige fussing a bit.  As I drifted awake, I noted that I was dreaming that the baby monitor downstairs was converting and streaming all the noises as XML.</p>
<p>The stream of XML was just spewing out into the air.  I remember just being happy to see the thing was working properly.  It's probably a good thing that the weekend is coming up.</p>
