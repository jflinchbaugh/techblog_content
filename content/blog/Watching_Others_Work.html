<p>I've recently been watching people use software, and I've been learning some great things for work and for play.</p>

<p>At work, we have a project tracking software which shows some real promise -- I really think it'll make life easier.  We're all learning how we want to use the software within our projects, and different teams are applying it in different ways.  Every time I watch someone use the software in a planning meeting, I'm scrawling notes like mad about new things to try.</p>
<p>Watching and working together in real time is a great way to learn features and tricks of new software.   The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a> people have been telling us this forever, and I had nearly forgotten the importance of pairing.</p>
<p>If you don't have a community of people using a piece of software, finding screen-cast podcasts could be the next best thing.</p>
<p>I've seen a few Photoshop video podcasts advertised, but the attention a video would demand just never felt worthwhile.  Finally, I discovered Rolf Steinort's excellent <a href = "http://www.meetthegimp.org/">Meet the Gimp</a> video podcast.  In just the first few episodes, I've discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>a few real applications of different layer blending methods for emulating correction layers</li>
<li>a new way to use the rotate tool for easier corrections</li>
<li>the 2 default dialog windows can be collapsed  into one big dialog</li>
<li>tools can be added and removed from the toolbar</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out this podcast, if you're using Gimp to edit photos.  If you're coding, be sure to pair occasionally -- you'll start using your tools more effectively and likely even discover some new ones.</p>
