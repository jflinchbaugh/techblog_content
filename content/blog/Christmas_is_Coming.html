<p>I'm more excited for Christmas this year than I've been in a long time.  I can't wait to sit down and play with Paige on Christmas morning.  She's going to be so excited.  Ben won't know what's going on, but he'll like the wrapping paper.</p>
<p>Paige had <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Family_Christmas_2003/pc240066">fun with paper</a> about this time 2 years ago.</p>
