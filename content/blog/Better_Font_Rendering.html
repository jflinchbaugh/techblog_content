<p><a href = "http://www.lifehacker.com">LifeHacker</a> had a quick little <a href = "http://www.lifehacker.com/software/monitors/avoid-computer-eye-strain-149003.php">link to techniques to reduce eye strain</a>.  The tip that caught my eye was enabling ClearType on Windows XP.  It's just subpixel rendering, but I hadn't realized that it made such a difference on CRTs -- I thought it was only good for LCD displays. </p>
<p>Seeing this improvement on my workstation prompted me to just go compare settings on my Linux notebook, and I found that I had actually lost my subpixel rendering settings a while back when I blew away my configurations.  I enabled it and was again quite pleased.  The settings are accessible in Gnome through the Desktop->Preferences->Font menu option, or by just running <code>gnome-font-properties</code>.</p>
<p><b>Update (4:50pm):</b> Sub-pixel and even normal antialiasing seem to not work very well for white on black terminals.  The white text looks shadowy, but black text on a white terminal looks very nice.  I've had to keep a blocky looking "Fixed" font for my terminals, since I use white on black.</p>
