<p>Tracking through java.net's weblog links, etc, I found this morsel of good information:
<a href = "http://www.westciv.com/style_master/academy/css_tutorial/selectors/index.html">CSS Selectors</a>.</p>
<p>It explains how to specify nested elements, directly nested elements, adjacent elements, all those weird little notations you may have seen in CSS but not fully understood.  I found it very enlightening.</p>
