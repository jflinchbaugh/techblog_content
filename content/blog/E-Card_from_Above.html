<p>I got an email from the person who's quite near (if not) the top of our organization with an e-card AVI file attached.  Being a cynic, I had just assumed it was the latest email virus, and it managed to actually get through the filters, so I didn't dare open it, and just forwarded it along to our email administrators.  It turns out it was a real birthday card.</p>
