<p>Paige, Claire, and I ran out to Taj Mahal last night for Indian food as my little birthday celebration.  It was very nice -- on Mondays, they happen to have a little buffet, so I got to try lots of different dishes.  We had no trouble finding good things to eat, which was sort of surprising.  I expected to find things I'd prefer to avoid, but that wasn't the case.  I could eat anything they had, as could Claire for the most part.  Paige wasn't really having any of it, though -- She's sort of picky right now.  We'll definitely go back.</p>
