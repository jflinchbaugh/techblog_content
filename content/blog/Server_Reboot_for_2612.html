<p>Linux 2.6.12 came out, so I finally upgraded and rebooted the server after running Linux 2.6.8.1 for just over 283 days.  This also afforded me the opportunity to install a cheap BT848 tuner/capture card and a donated 3DFX Voodoo3.</p>
<p>I intend to try to setup some sort of web-controlled PVR with the BT848.  I mostly want to be able to record a few network television shows for later viewing.  At the slow and rocky pace, I'll get it working by the time analog video signals are replaced by digital.</p>
<p>The Voodoo3 moves my video processing onto the AGP bus from the PCI bus, and allows smooth playback of video and audio at the same time on the box -- I'll be able to edit video on that box nicely now.  I do have an odd console issue where my console font gets slightly corrupted when I switch back to a VC from X, but a <code>consolechars -d</code> corrects it.  Initial Google searches have been fruitless.</p>
