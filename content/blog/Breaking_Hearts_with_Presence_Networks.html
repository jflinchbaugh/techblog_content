<p>I found <a href = "http://www.groovr.com/user/jflinchbaugh/">Groovr</a> a bit lacking in features, so I jumped to <a href ="http://twitter.com/jflinchbaugh">Twitter</a>.  At that point, I had started wondering how I can <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/My_Own_Little_Web_20">pull it all back together</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, one of the primary people I've been watching in Twitter, Leo Laporte, <a href = "http://leoville.vox.com/library/post/goodbye-twitter-hello-jaiku.html">jumped ship to go to Jaiku</a>.  Besides now having Leo Laporte, <a href = "http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> has a couple extra features over Twitter.  Most interestingly, you can import feeds from other networks to aggregate everything into one place!</p>
<p>So...I have an <a href = "http://jflinchbaugh.jaiku.com/">account</a> there now too.  (That's 3 accounts now.)  In addition to my microblog/presence there, I'm importing my feeds for Flickr, Twitter friends, weblog, and I'll probably add my Last.fm feed too.  This is sort of slick.</p>
<p>Of course, it won't take much to break the hearts of thousands again when someone comes out with the next Twitter + 1 or Jaiku + 1 service which does all this and one more thing, and we all jump again.  This is a game to see who can run fastest to hang onto the crowd for that extra 10 seconds.</p>
