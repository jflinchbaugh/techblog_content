<p>I spent yesterday setting up a shiny new Gateway desktop for my mother-in-law.  I got to see the insides before I even booted it, since I dropped the old harddrive into the new machine to facilitate faster copying of her old data.</p>
<p>The construction and layout on the inside was very standard and clean -- it seemed to be built for easy disassembly.  They also did away with those little seal stickers. (It's been a long time since I've worked with consumer-grade machines.)</p>

<p>I booted it up, answered a bunch of Gateway/setup questions, got it to a very clean desktop -- There was nothing but the Recycling Bin, no pollution.  The Start Menu is a different story, but it still wasn't too bad!</p>
<p>The dirty parts come from using AOL all day, punching in licensing keys, staving off product registrations and advertisements from Gateway, Norton, Microsoft, AOL, etc.  I think I wasted more time doing that stuff than real work at times.  I couldn't help but realize how long it's been since I've had to do those things.  It's a good feeling. :)</p>
<p>Anyway, the machine's up and running nicely, and I'm pretty sure she's got the hang of it, so all is well.</p>
