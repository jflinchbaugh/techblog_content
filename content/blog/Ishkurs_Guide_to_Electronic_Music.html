<p><a href = "http://www.ishkur.com/">Ishkur</a> has long maintained an excellent (and entertaining) <a href = "http://www.di.fm/edmguide/edmguide.html">guide to electronic music</a> complete with a map of relationships and lots of samples.  It's fun to click around and see what clips you actually recognize.  I may have to start listening to some of the streams that are associated with the types I recognize (<i>from my youth, but that's a different story, sonny....</i>).</p>
<p>I had seen the old version years ago, and <a href = "http://www.shoutstudios.com/~doug/blog/">Doug's</a> interest in electronic music sparked my interest enough to dig up this link again.  Now I'll never lose it again.</p>
