<p><a href = "http://www.rockpointonline.com/">Todd</a> (not <a href = "http://www.shoutstudios.com/~doug/blog/">Doug</a>, because he never tells me anything I guess) showed me the public web page for Lancaster's <a href = "http://www.lcwc.co.lancaster.pa.us/lcwc/lcwc/publiccad.asp">computer-aided dispatch (CAD)</a> system.  This is definitely interesting for information junkies.</p>

<p>Emergency dispatch has come a long, long way from my radio scanner days.  Several years ago, I had developed a bit of reporting software for fire incident tracking and quarterly reporting, then web-enabled it later.  I never even could have imagined really having this information in real-time.  I'd love to work with these systems again.  I can add this to my list of things I'd like to implement just for the sake of doing it myself  (along with weblog software, bug tracking, the rave database, etc).</p>
