<p>Some big thinkers have for quite some time been <a href = "http://www.jroller.com/page/rickard/20031213">voicing disapproval</a> of JBoss' practices (antics?).  For the first time, I'm really starting to wonder if the JBoss crowd is misleading us down a less respectable path.  Thay <i>are</i> sort of crazy, but it takes that fringe element to draw attention and sway people. Richard Stallman does this for the <a href = "http://www.gnu.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.  The normal people fall somewhere short, but look all the saner compared to the zealots.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that we should avoid coding to a specific platform as much as possible, so if our platform of choice (JBoss) does go down the tubes, we can move elsewhere, like <a href = "http://incubator.apache.org/projects/geronimo/">Apache Geronimo</a>.  Of course, some people have <a href = "http://www.jroller.com/page/fate/?anchor=commons_primitives_is_vile_and">plenty to say</a> about <a href = "http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache Jakarta</a> projects as well.  Oh well, stay fluid and don't rely too heavily upon any one server, framework, whatever.</p>
