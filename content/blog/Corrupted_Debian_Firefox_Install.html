<p>A long time back, I had issues with Mozilla's XUL files getting corrupted, then simple dialog boxes would no longer show.  Instead, I'd get XUL XML parsing errors.</p>
<p>Firefox recently did it to me too.  Watching the Debian user mailing list, someone else noted this, and they concluded that /tmp had run out of space during install, and the install script silently failed to build the files correctly.  I cleaned up /tmp and tried again, and now it's fine.</p>
