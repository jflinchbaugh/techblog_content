<p>Claire's <a href = "http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=591">Motorola V551</a> is frustrating me terribly these days.  I can browse and pull its files from my SE S710a, but <a href = "http://triq.net/obexftp.html"><code>obexftp</code></a> on my Debian notebook just fails to connect to it.  I can't push files to it either from the notebook.  I <em>can</em> push files from the phone to the notebook though.</p>
<p>I think I had read on a mailing list somewhere that obexftp or openobex may be missing some headers in the bluetooth communication, and this is what causes some other Motorola phones so unhappy, but I can't find that information these days.  There was rumor of a patch, but it's still not working with the latest version from Debian unstable (0.10.7+0.10.8pre9-1).</p>
<p>I'm positive this should work, and the fault probably lies with my Linux software, but I just want to see a fix.  I can't believe no one else has ever tried this phone with Linux, but that's what Google would have me believe.  It seems to be a super-slick phone otherwise.</p>
<p><b>Update (9 November 2005):</b>
I've found that plain old minicom talking to an rfcomm device doesn't work with this phone either.  Maybe it's my Linux kernel bluetooth stack?</p>
<p><b>Update (10 November 2005):</b>
I've found that obexftp and even minicom (after a <code>cat /dev/rfcomm2</code>) work if it's the first time the devices are pairing.  After that, the phone keeps disconnecting.</p>
