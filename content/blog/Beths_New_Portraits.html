<p>I had the pleasure of photographing <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Photography/2009-10-11_Warner_Family/">Beth and her family</a> back in the Fall for the <a href = "http://www.imagesforacure.com/">Images for a Cure</a> fundraiser, so I was eager to shoot an update image 6 months later (and with her current, less <em>extreme</em> hair style).</p>
<p>Beth and her team will be doing the <a href = "http://www.the3day.org/site/TR/2010/WashingtonDCEvent2010?px=4907811&pg=personal&fr_id=1474&et=W7n6PtwahJyv13lKW9sAWA..&s_tafId=237855">3-Day for the Cure</a> fundraising walk -- 60 miles in 3 days in Washington DC on 8-10 October 2010.</p>
