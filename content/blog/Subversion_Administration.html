<p>I've started reading <a href = "http://apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10203">Practical Subversion, Second Edition</a> which <a href = "http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> kindly sent to me.  It's inspired me to poke around with the <code>svnadmin</code> command to migrate some of my old repositories on my notebook to the new formats (fsfs) on my normal source code server.</p>
<p>The dump, load, and <code>switch --relocate</code> of my working copy were dead simple.  I look forward to reminding myself of some of the more powerful Subversion features, as well as learn about the enhancements since I've first started using it.</p>
