<p>I've added topics to my blog.  Yay.  I have to say, it's coming along nicely.  I still have a bit I want to implement though (RSS, search, email notification, comment editing maybe, dynamic links, etc).  Navigation could always be enhanced as well.</p><p>I feel like I'm getting a reasonable understanding of Struts as well.</p>
