<p>Occassionally, I play with my T616, and it'll decide not to do something I want it to do. Often this is some bluetooth operation.  It likes to blare out this obnoxiously loud little song anytime something fails.  It's especially embarassing when sitting amongst other quiet cube-dwellers at work. I can't find a way to just disable the error tones (like I can the key tones).</p>
<p>I've recently discovered that <em>silent mode</em> actually quells all these little noises, so when pushing files around with bluetooth, the 15 people within earshot won't need to know when it decided to fail.  I still need to hear the ring sometimes, though, so I must remember to switch the ringer back on when I'm done.</p>
