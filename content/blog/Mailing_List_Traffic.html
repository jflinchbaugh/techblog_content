<p>I must have learned something, or I'm getting too old to keep up.  I'm dropping subscriptions to a couple mailing lists which I've found myself more and more just deleting and not reading.  These include SANE and JBoss mailing lists.</p>

<p>I was on SANE when support for my CanoScan N670U was just being integrated -- that works fine now, so no need to follow news there.  JBoss has been working pretty nicely for me, and anytime I have troubles, I end up searching the forums anyway.  This will leave some mental bandwidth for things I'm more actively learning, like linux-kernel, jakarta-struts, xdoclet, and Debian.</p>
<p>I also dropped DCRaves, since that one's pretty noisy as well, and it's been a long time since I saw any good info for events I'd go to in my immediate area.</p>
