<p>Most of our new deck is framed, so we can really see the size and shape of it.  It's quite exciting to see our design actually implemented.  We set the piers and framed two-thirds of the entire deck in about 9 hours on Saturday.  Next comes a bit of electrical work and the decking.  The other one-third of the deck will probably wait a bit until either the ground thaws a bit and/or we can rent big digging tools.</p>
<p>We also looked at lighting, and we have some great ideas.   I think I'll push to get the stone work done right away as well, after the deck is done just so I can see the whole thing in all its glory.</p>
<p>I've finally gotten some <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Deck">pictures</a> together, including my <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Deck/deck">CAD design</a> which we are following.</p>
