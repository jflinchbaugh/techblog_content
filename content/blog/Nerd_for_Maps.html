<p>I'm a complete nerd for maps.  I was trying to figure out the altitude of my house (to calibrate the altimeter on my watch, of course).  I stumbled upon <a href = "http://www.topozone.com/">TopoZone</a>.  They have USGS topgraphic maps of various scales online!  It's interesting to see, but they don't seem terribly printable.  Since they're trying to sell paper copies of these maps, I understand.</p>
<p>I used to have USGS maps of the areas around my house and other places that I often found myself (Boy Scout camps, etc).  I know how to use the maps with the compass and all that stuff, so it could be useful/fun to have when biking.</p>
<p>Armed with the digital compass on my watch, and a new mobile phone which can access and display these online maps, I could be unstoppable...as long as my batteries last, anyway! ;)</p>
