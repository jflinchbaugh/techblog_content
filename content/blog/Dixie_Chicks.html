<p>It sounds like <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5742229">The Dixie Chicks are still having a rough time</a> after the anti-Bush comments of one member 3 years ago.  They remain mostly unapologetic and bitter about the way the music scene, radio programmers, and fans have treated them as well -- their latest single is titled <em>Not Ready To Make Nice</em>.</p>
<p>I saw them live years and years ago at a <a href = "http://www.lilithfair.com/">Lilith Fair</a>.  I don't care much for country music, but we were all howling with laughter and appreciation when they sang the very entertaining <a href = "http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/dixie+chicks/goodbye+earl_20040999.html"><em>Goodbye Earl</em></a>.</p>
<p>I almost feel like I should go out and buy the new CD just to support them for trying to make their statement.</p>
