<p>I'm seeing trackback spam now linking to simple Google searches for a single garbled string.  I can't figure out what it may be accomplishing, since the search results in nothing.  I must wonder if it's just a test hit to confirm that trackback works for my site and index me for later attack.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how these bogus search links may benefit anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Update (12:40pm):</strong>  I looked at the access logs, and these requests are coming from all over the place, and I see each client hit the permalink, submit a trackback, then hit the permalink again, as if to check that the trackback was accepted.  Interesting.</p>
<p>These requests also all come in for the same page, so it may be some weird centrally-controlled bot network.</p>
