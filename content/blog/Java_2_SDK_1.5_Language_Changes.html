<p>Having glanced at a few <a href = "http://zamples.com/JspExplorer/samples/samplesJDK1_5.html">examples</a> of the new 1.5 code, I'm not sure I welcome these changes.  It's probably just a case of knee-jerk concerns about backward compatibility.  I guess they were trying to make the language easier to use, but they've introduced complexities.</p>

<p>Autoboxing looks too much like the String concatenation mess.  Everyday I curse other developers for having concatenated Strings instead of using the StringBuffer.  This just looks like more of the same possibly inefficient behind-the-scenes work done by the language.  Hiding the real object-oriented method calls just breaks the simple paradigm for me.</p>
<p>Generics also seem complex as well.  I'd rather just implement my own collections that check and enforce a type, instead of having the language magically do it.  This extends Java beyond the realm of simple, easy rules into complex C++ land.  Variable arguments are the same way -- I could have just used an <code>Object[]</code> array.</p>
<p>I know when I came to Java from C, I missed my Enums, but after a couple years, I can't remember for what I would have wanted them.  <code>printf</code> and importing static methods could be slick without causing me too many headaches.</p>
<p>I'm probably just clinging to the old familiar limitations like an old assembly language programmer.</p>
