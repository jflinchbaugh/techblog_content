<p>What's a <a href = "http://www.i4u.com/article5207.html">bluetooth watch</a> do?  It displays incoming phone calls and that sort of thing, but even more usefully, it warns you when you've forgotten your phone.  That's great!  I could have used that today.  Of course, it probably also goes nuts when your phone dies, or you turn it off, but who does that?</p>
