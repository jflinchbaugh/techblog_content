<p>I have my first TrackBack ping support built into my weblog now.  When saving the article, if the "Ping TrackBack" checkbox is checked, the save action will send a message to the TrackBackPing MDB.</p>
<p><a href = "http://www.ryangrier.com/">Ryan</a> has seen a couple of my tests in his weblog, since he actually implements trackback, and I figured he wouldn't mind too much.  Thanks Ryan.</p>
