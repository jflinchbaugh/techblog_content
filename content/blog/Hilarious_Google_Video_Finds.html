<p>It's amazing how you can waste time finding odd stuff on Google Video, so for your entertainment, I offer: <a href = "http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1047157044159649860">Beat Boxin' Bush</a>, and <a href = "http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7997646050642417046">The Internet is for Porn: The Musical</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just that I've never played World of Warcraft, but I'm always so surprised to see what you can make those avatars do.</p>
