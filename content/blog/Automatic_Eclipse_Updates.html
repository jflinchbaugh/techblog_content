<p>I've just now gotten a spare moment to go downloading the Eclipse 3.1.2 to update my current 3.1.1.  Upgrading is time-consuming, so I've delayed it.  While getting to the download, I stumbled upon this a link explaining how to <a href = "http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-releng/updatesfor3.1.1.html">upgrade using the automatic updates</a>!</p>
<p>I <em>thought</em> the automatic update should have been able to get it, but it just never showed up, so I figured I needed to do the install by hand.  The update is much nicer.</p>
