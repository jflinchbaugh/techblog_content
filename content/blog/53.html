<p>The sun seems to keep <a href = "http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solar_flares_031103.html">hurling stuff</a> at us, but I have yet to take the time to wander out looking for auroras.  I've always wanted to see these things, but my immediate area (backyard) is pretty well covered by trees, and I fear the city glow could be too much.</p>
<p>Stacey, maybe you'll get another chance with your good camera.  Todd's place may be an especially good place to be this evening.</p>
