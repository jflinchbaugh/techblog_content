<p>Following the <a href = "http://www.lmapa.org/exhibits/lancaster_lens/">Lancaster Lens</a> show and my first <a href = "http://www.johnflinchbaugh.com/photography/workshops/current">lighting workshop</a> in 2012, I'd like to invite photographers to bring their toys, cameras, and imaginations out to Smith LaVia Studio on <strong>First Friday, 3 August</strong>, for a free workshop.</p>
<p>It'll be a chance to play around and expand your lighting skills, composition, and story-telling.  Stop by and visit -- we'll be shooting all night starting at 6pm.</p>
<p>Suite 210<br/>
