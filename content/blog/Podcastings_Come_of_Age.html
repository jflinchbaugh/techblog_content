<p>Up to this point, I've regarded podcasting as a curiosity, but haven't bothered really looking at it, but it seems that its day may have come.  <a href = "http://leoville.com/blog/index.php/TLR/comments/the-revenge-of-the-bleep/">Revenge of the ScreenSavers</a> is available as a podcast.  It's some of the old ScreenSavers people from the good old TechTV days.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll need to figure out the slick podcast way to download this thing, but just getting it manually and playing it on the computer is fine by me too.  I also don't have any other device but the computer on which to play it.  Maybe I can burn it to CDRW for in the car without having to run the notebook.</p>
