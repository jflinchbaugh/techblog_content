<p>Claire and I are exhausted, and it's Monday.  We've had a busy, busy weekend and forgot to rest.</p>
<p>Over the 3-day weekend, we've run to Philadelphia, gone to Karen's baby shower, an Easter lunch, Hayden's birthday party, thrown a small deck party, and shopped and shopped finding supplies (and firewood) for that party.  We also bought Paige a cute little car of her very own. :)</p>
