<p>I was really surprised by how easily he could talk to other people, and how many stall owners said they like to be asked permission for photos.</p>
<p>Talking to people and asking permission to photograph is one of those things I really need to practice.  I'm generally awkward talking to strangers, so I just try to avoid it.  This leaves me being rude and sniping pictures from afar, or more often, just avoiding photographing people.  I remember a handful of times when I wish I could have taken a picture but hesitated.  Now that I realize how important it can be (and beneficial for me to just learn to talk to people), I'll try to be better about trying portraits and asking permission.</p>
