<p>I have that handy list of comics over in the navbar, but I've not had time to visit in the past month.  I've finally gotten back to them save one -- <a href = "http://www.megatokyo.com/">MegaTokyo</a>.  It's a bit more involved with more to read and absorb, so I've saved it for last.  The funny thing is that even though I know I've been away for a month or so, I'm pretty sure I'll find only 2 hours or so have passed in MegaTime, maybe a whole day.</p>
<p>The artwork is amazing, so it's worth the wait, but I'm starting to think this may be a better one to read in comic book format where I can rip through a bit quicker.</p>
