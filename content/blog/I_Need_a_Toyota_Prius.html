<p>Toyota does some of the <a href = "http://www.toyota.com/html/shop/look_ahead/">coolest stuff</a>, including the new Prius which can <a href = "http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/09/01/toyota.prius.reut/index.html">park itself</a>!  (Do also treat yourselves to the RSC, Fine-S, and POD links on that first page.)</p>
<p>It's like the tree-hugging geeks night-rider!  I want one.  If you've spoken to me in person, you know I've wanted one for a long time.  The new one coming out real soon is supposed to be even cheaper and more versatile with it's hatchback and fold-down seats.</p>
<p>Do other car companies do cool stuff like this?  I just never hear of anyone quite like Toyota.  I definitely want to support them.  I should have bought the ECHO when I had the chance, though my Mazda Protege is fun to drive.</p>
