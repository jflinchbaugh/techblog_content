<p>It's workshop season again, so come out and visit for the <strong>Free Toy Photography Workshop</strong> on First Friday, 5 April 2013.  Bring your camera, lights, and toys (of course), and play along.  It'll be a chance to play around and expand your lighting skills, composition, and story-telling.  Stop by and visit &mdash; we'll be shooting all night starting at 6pm.</p>
<p>A couple weeks later, we'll be doing 2 more half-day workshops on speedlights and event photography.  Registration is open now for those and spots are <em>very limited</em>, so check out the <a href = "http://www.johnflinchbaugh.com/photography/workshops/current">details on the workshop page</a>.</p>
