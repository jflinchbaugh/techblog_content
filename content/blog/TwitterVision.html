<p><a href = "http://www.groovr.com/">Groovr</a> has its growing pains with its location system.  I keep accidentally checking into other people's work, or otherwise creating duplicate locations in the wrong cities.</p>
<p>I've been watching <a href = "http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> as an alternative, and now it seems that <a href = "http://twittermap.com/twittervision">TwitterVision</a> adds <a href = "http://twittermap.com/maps/faq.html">location</a> to the service.  The alias system looks like just the right solution, so maybe I'll create a Twitter account now.</p>
<p>To be honest, it's sometimes hard to remember to update Groovr, but now that I think about it, I may miss posting photos if I switch to Twitter.  <em>Hmmm...</em>  Really, I just wish Groovr would get their location/alias system working better.  They're shooting for shared hot spots on which people can converge and otherwise socially interact, but I just want geo-tracking and a photo stream.</p>
