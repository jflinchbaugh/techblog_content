<p>I've been staring all day at lists of methods, shell scripts, and code.  I'm locating and cleaning out abandoned EJB methods.  I'm tired.  This isn't busy work I've been assigned -- I've assigned myself this responsibility, because I'm a neat freak who takes to mundane tasks like code reformatting, refactoring, and today, cruft removal.  Tomorrow, when I get to the real work, it'll be all the easier, and I'll be able to focus.</p>
