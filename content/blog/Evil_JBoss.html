<p>I have no idea what people are talking about when they start slamming Marc Fleury and JBoss.  He's very opinionated, confrontational, and tries to make money with his work.  Great.  I'm just glad I can use the server for my projects.  If someone  feels he's unfairly profitting from others' work, then they should stop contributing or really piss off Marc and fork JBoss for their own use.  If I were so useful as to be able to  contribute code to the project, I'd see it as a small price to pay to make the server do what I want.  Yay, JBoss. ;)</p>
