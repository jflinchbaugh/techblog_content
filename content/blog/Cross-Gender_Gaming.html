<p>After reading another little weblog about <a href = "http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/1256">cross-gender gaming characters</a>, I had to think why I usually play female characters myself.</p>
<p>It's nothing nearly as complicated as the article explains, since I'm just looking at console or computer games, not intense role-playing.  I just find that the female characters are sleeker and seem faster (even when they're not).  They also tend to be smaller and maybe a bit harder to hit in the first-person shooters.  Many of them remind me of what I'd expect from William Gibson's cyberpunk female characters, like Molly.  Who wouldn't want to be slick like Molly?</p>
<p>I also like to differentiate myself in the FPS from the other manly-men*, so I'll play a faerie or something cutesy.  People have just come to expect it from me, and I think it's a humorous way to poke fun at the whole game.</p>
<p>* (I also differentiate myself by sucking horribly at most games.)</p>
