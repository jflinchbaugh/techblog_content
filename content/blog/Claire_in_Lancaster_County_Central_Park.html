<p>The <a href = "http://www.lancastercameraclub.org/">Lancaster Camera Club</a> hosted an outdoor portrait event at Lancaster County Central Park in the Garden of the Five Senses, so I (easily) convinced Claire to get all dolled up and come out to be my model.
</p>
<p>10s of people showed up for the event of all levels of experience, and after a very quick introduction, they all set out shooting with the various models that came out.  I figured that I had my model, my lights, and camera, so Claire and I stepped aside, found our initial setting, and started shooting.</p>
<p>Our starting spot was hidden from others by some bushes, so I setup my light stand and new softbox out in the open, so people could see I was down there as we were getting started.  One person joined us, I dialed in the lights for her, and she got shooting a little bit observing how the strobe worked balanced with the ambient evening light. Claire did a great job working with other photographers.</p>

<p>We continued a slow lap around the gardens, mostly by ourselves, getting shots along various paths, then caught up with the group.  One of the club leaders, Doug, was demonstrating using a big gold reflector with some models on the little waterfall fountains in the middle of the garden.</p>

<p>We played a bit there, watched others for a bit, then wandered back out into the open to shoot some more.</p>

<p>Through the night, I'd jump in occasionally and try to grab a few shots with other models in other people's setups, but I wasn't really trying, and I didn't have the necessary control, so I didn't have anything worth keeping other than my shots with Claire.  Those came out wonderfully.</p>
<p>I shot mostly with the 50mm f/1.8, and maybe a little with the 28mm f/2.8.  Once I started using the new 28" softbox, I didn't really stop -- it's nice and light and easy to carry on the stand.  I'd occasionally pop out the silver reflector whe I needed that extra fill light from the bottom of the image.</p>
<p>I can't wait to get out again with Claire to shoot -- just from the couple images we got, I have more ideas.  It was a great location, but I can do alright in most locations, I think, especially if I can shoot Claire.</p>
