<p>The <a href = "http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> JSR (<a href = "http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=2490">JSR-241</a>) has been <a href = "http://today.java.net/pub/n/GroovyJSRRBApproved">approved</a>, so I guess it may actually become a standard scripting language for Java.</p>
<p>I had said before that I regarded these scripting languages as passing fads, and they may still be, but it seems this one may have a few more moments to live.  I'll have to follow that link and check it out.  The idea is intriguing, but I don't have time to waste studying methods that won't last.</p>
