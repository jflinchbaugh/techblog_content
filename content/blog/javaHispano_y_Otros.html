<p>Watching <a href = "http://www.javablogs.com">java.blogs</a>, I've been quietly getting angry about all the non-english posts I see there.  These posts are taking up valuable page real estate and pushing the articles I understand off the list.</p>

<p>The <a href = "http://www.javahispano.org">Hispanic faction</a> seems especially proud to be posting Java news in their native language.  Instead of gnashing my teeth and skipping over these articles in hopes to find something useful, I'm actually going to start reading them as an opportunity to hone my aging Spanish language skills.  Based on a couple years of high school Spanish and a familiar context (Java), the articles are actually about half intelligible.  Add in a bit of <a href = "http://babelfish.altavista.com"/>the fish</a>, and I can fill in the parts I didn't understand initially.  Given a bit of practice, I expect it won't be long before I'm reading these without assistance.</p>
