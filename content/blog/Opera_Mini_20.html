<p><a href = "http://mini.opera.com">Opera Mini 2.0</a> is out, and it works pretty nicely on my S710a.  It looked good on Doug's T616 as well.  It's contending with Google Local for Mobile as my favorite application on my phone.</p>
<p>The user interface has improved a bit -- the scrolling page history thing is just interesting, but the ability to fire off the platform web browser to download and save files is very welcome.</p>
