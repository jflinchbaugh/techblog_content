<p>I got to work up a bit of a sweat on Saturday running around the house with the camera.  I had the kids constructing red circles of rocks, digging out their toys, and dumping pitchers of water on the deck to make some puddles.  They also got to bury some of my tools in the garden.</p>
<p>The kids didn't really require much explanation at the time to participate, but they were helping me setup photos for the first <a href = "http://www.meetup.com/lancaster-photographers/calendar/10754268/">Lancaster Photographers' Scavenger Hunt</a> on <a href = "http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a>.</p
<p>I had decided to not spend the entire time slot by myself shooting, but instead hang out at home with the family and get other things done, so I came down to the last 1.5 hours of the scavenger hunt with very little to show.  That's when I started getting serious and setting up the shots and knocking them out.</p>
<p>I only got 10 of the shots in the end, but I was pretty happy with them.  Here are some of the highlights of what the kids helped me setup:</p>
