<p>I attended the <a href = "http://www.harrisburgjug.org/">Harrisburg JUG</a> meeting a couple weeks ago (I've been terrible about getting this posted) to hear <a href = "http://www.harrisburgjug.org/display/JUG/2007-11-15+Apache+Maven">Neil Hall talk about Maven</a>.</p>
<p>Neil did a great job showing off Maven and relating his story of introducing it to his organization.  It looks like a really slick tool to use for the next project I bootstrap.</p>
<p>I'm not as impressed with the dependency management as I am with its ability to just build and package a project with minimal configuration -- I just need to structure my project the right way.  I used to have philosophical conflicts when a tool imposed its will on me like this, but I've gotten over it while learning to use Eclipse.</p>
