<p>The <a href = "http://www.google.com/gmm/">Google Maps Mobile</a> page is so void of details that I can't tell what version number they've released or even when they release them.  The client really should alert you when there's a new version.</p>
<p>I've just happened to stumble upon the latest (1.3.1) version, because I saw mention of the traffic feature which I did not have.  I wasn't positive of what version I was getting until I actually downloaded it to the phone.  I found a quick message buried in a Google Group about a new release, but nowhere <em>official</em>, like the homepage for the thing.</p>
<p>It really is my current killer app on my phone, and they keep making it better, but they need to market it a bit more effectively.</p>
