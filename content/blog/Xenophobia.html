<p>I have new neighbors in Cubeville, and for some irrational reason, I find these people quite disturbing.  It's the infiltration of new voices talking about non-tech on the <em>telephone</em>.  I'm accustomed only to the <em>tic</em> and <em>tac</em> of keyboards, and maybe a few voices which I've already tuned out.</p>
<p>Additionally, they've clogged our hallways with behemoth filing cabinets presumably full of <em>paper</em>.  They apparently didn't get the email recommending we just save documents on the computer and stop printing them.  Honestly, I have a grand total of maybe 30 sheets of paper littering my entire workspace.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have no idea who Myron Cope is, and I don't know what makes his towel so terrible, except maybe that it's hanging from another invading filing cabinet and represents everything I don't understand, and therefore, fear.</p>
