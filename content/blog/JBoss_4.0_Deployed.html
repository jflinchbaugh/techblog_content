<p>I've successfully deployed JBoss 4.0 on my laptop and on the server.  It was actually much easier than I had expected.  It seems that some of the pain I experienced in the middle of the 3.2.x series was bringing me up to speed for 4.0, so it really didn't look that different.  I've also noticed a tendency toward more sane default configs, so I didn't have to mess with as much of it, such as the Tomcat classloader.</p>
<p>I have my CMP entities, my session facade bean, a message bean, and my struts 1.2.4 webtier deployed.</p>
