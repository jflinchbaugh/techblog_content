<p>I took the very "scenic" route to work today which took me through the very burned out town of Steelton.  Sprinkle that with a bit of 9/11 news on the radio, and it's already a down sort of day.  The worst part was pulling up behind a car with a happy little bumper sticker with joyful little stick people.  Then I read, "Marriage: One Man One Woman (NoGayMarriage.com)".</p>
<p>I just wasn't prepared for that little reminder of the kind of people who run rampant these days.  Who are these people who don't have enough in their own lives that they need to worry about what others do in their private lives.</p>
<p>Strike <em>marriage</em> from the law, replace it with an equally protected <em>civil union</em>, and I'll be among the first in line to abandon the tainted and filthy term.  It was obviously a mistake to write it into the law.</p>
