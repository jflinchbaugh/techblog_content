<p>A couple weekends ago, I setup a sort of photo booth for a kid's birthday party a couple weekends ago.  With Claire's help, I shot nearly 30 quick portraits, processed them, and printed the 4x6 copies on-site to be used in a crafty framing activity.</p>
<p>To make the project work, I recruited Claire to give me a hand talking to people and printing, and I picked up the cool little <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Canon_Selphy_CP770">Selphy CP770 printer</a>.  We setup a backdrop and a few strobes to give me some options while shooting, but I shot most of the portraits with fun angles requiring the kids to sit or for me to stand on the chair. I also mixed it up a bit with some more normal portraits.</p>
<p>Some people seemed convinced that I could have used a second printer, but that's just because the printer was the boring part to watch.  The real bottleneck was my trying to switch between shooting and processing, since I was the only one who could do it.  Next time around, a second photographer would make it easier -- I'm too much of a control freak to let suggest that I should shoot and let someone else process, though it's a really the most efficient way to split the work.</p>
<p>The whole thing was a great challenge, especially in managing time, but I love how it came together in just 3 hours.  I also shot a few group shots, but those didn't need to be delivered right away.</p>
