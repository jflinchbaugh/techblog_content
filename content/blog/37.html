I took down the Wedding website finally.  It was getting embarassing to see <i>"The wedding was 430 days ago!"</i>.  Now it's just a <a href = "http://wedding.hjsoft.com/">collection of links</a>.  It  also includes a zip of the entire source tree to the old application.  If you care about really old CMP implementations in JBoss, you're in luck.

<p>That also means that you people who still want to vote up the Chicken Dance are out of luck.  Sorry.  Take it to <a href = "http://www.billboard.com/">Billboard.com</a>.</p>
