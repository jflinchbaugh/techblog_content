<p>I got out to the SpongeBeat TechnoPants party in Harrisburg the other weekend.  It was in an abandoned furniture store or something like that.   The music wasn't amazing or anything, but the lights and people were fun, so I got to take <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/SpongeBeat_TechnoPants_2005-02-19">lots of pictures</a>.</p>
<p>I also have <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/DragonFly_2005-02-12"> pictures from DragonFly</a> the previous weekend.  There aren't many, because I spent most the time dancing.</p>
<p>Next up is a DnB party in York at the Waterway later in March.  That's a much more convenient location than Harrisburg.</p>
