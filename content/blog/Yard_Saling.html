<p>Having owned my own house for over 2 years now, I  finally sort of admitted that I may need more lawn equipment -- In this case, a little Black and Decker electric trimmer.  For $5 at a yard sale, I figured I may as well.</p>
<p>I didn't want to admit it, but the lawn looks much better now with the additional 10 minutes of work.  At least it barely cost me anything.</p>

<p>I also bought a spare HP LaserJet 4L which actually works!  Laser printers are just so reliable and economical -- long lasting toner instead of crap ink that's dry every time I need to print something.</p>
<p>Paige made out the best of everyone, though, with lots of toys and a couple hotdogs.</p>
