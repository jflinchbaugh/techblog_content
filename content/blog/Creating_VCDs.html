<p>I've been faithfully compressing my edited video into MPEGs suitable for Standard VCDs.  I've finally gotten around to trying to burn these onto CD and see what they do.</p>
<p>It's not quite as simple as just sticking the file into an ISO9660 image and going.  I had to feed the MPEG file to <code>vcdimager</code>.  That produced a CD image and a  cue config file for <code>cdrdao</code>.</p>
<p>The CD played just fine in my cheap DVD player, and it looked good!  It was about VHS quality, I would say.  An attempt to burn a 12-minute video resulted in a shorter truncated video, so I'll have to look into that, but it's at least a start.</p>
<p>I now have a conventional way to distribute video that only requires a common and accessible consumer-grade DVD player.  Yay, toys!...and Paige videos for the grandparents.</p>
