<p>One rainy Sunday in May, Dustin, his family, and I hurried down to Lock 12 in York County to get some last-minute senior portraits even as it rained.  The rain stopped when we got there, and the overcast skies treated us well for a two-hour portrait session around the lock and the creek trail above the lock.</p>
<p>Briana's interested in studying photography, so she volunteered to hold the lights most the time, and I even held the lights for her for a shot or two &mdash; you can see one of her shots at the end of the <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Photography/2011-05-14_Dustin_Senior_Portrait/">whole gallery</a>.

<p>I cycled through my normal lighting modifiers for the shoot, like the umbrella and the grid spot, but my favorite for the shoot was the little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y322RO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnflinswebl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B003Y322RO">Fotodiox 8"x12" softbox</a>.  It was small and light, so it could be stuck on the end of the monopod and placed close anywhere in a scene. It's smaller size cast a more masculine hard light than my larger modifiers.</p>
