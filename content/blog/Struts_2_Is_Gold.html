<p>A while back, I had <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Abandon_Struts_for_Something_Anything_Else">strayed from a very fragmented Struts framework</a> to explore <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Starting_with_WebWork">WebWork </a> instead.  At that point, I wasn't all that sure anything useful would emerge from the mess of Struts chaining (1.3), actions (2.0), and Shale.  Once I had started with WebWork, I didn't care what happened to Struts, but today I got news that <a href = "http://struts.apache.org/2.0.6/">Struts 2.0.6</a> has finally been released for general availability, and I'm really glad.  Nearly a year of happily using WebWork makes the new Struts 2 look incredibly familiar and comfortable.  I look forward to porting some applications to the new Struts, since this is where future development of the WebWork-style framework will proceed.</p>
<p>Way back when, I had experimented with integrating commons-chain with Struts 1.2 in preparation for Struts 1.3, but I never did get around to actually using 1.3.  WebWork was much more compelling.</p>
