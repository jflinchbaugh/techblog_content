<p>Right as we arrived for the softball game, the dark clouds started rolling in to the North.  It looked like it might pass us by, so the coaches decided to wait it out a bit.</p>
<p>We took shelter in the nearby pavilion, but after about 20 minutes of still waiting and the storm having not even started dumping rain and hail on us, we ended up having to call it an postpone for another day.</p>
