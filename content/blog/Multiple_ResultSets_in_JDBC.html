<p>I've never had the occasion to even expect to have more than one ResultSet returned by one execution of a Statement, but that's exactly what I got to do today.  It seems that any query <code>execute()</code>ed from a sybase stored proc drops a ResultSet, so I need to iterate through them to get <u>all</u> the results, not just rows in a single ResultSet. </p>
<p>Here's a bit of example code to demonstrate navigating through the multiple ResultSets:</p>
<pre>
    CallableStatment cstmt =
        conn.prepareQuery("{ call my_proc() }");
    cstmt.execute();
    ResultSet rs = null;
    do {
        // don't process update counts, only resultsets
        if ((rs = cstmt.getResultSet()) != null) {
            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println(rs.getString("field"));
            }
        }
    } while (cstmt.getMoreResults()  // advance current rs
        || cstmt.getUpdateCount() != -1); // case of update count
</pre>
<p>For any more info, check your local javadocs.</p>
