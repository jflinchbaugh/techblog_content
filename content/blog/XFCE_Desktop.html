<p>I've written about <a href = "/blog/link/Desktop_Luddite">trying new desktops</a> previously, and how much trouble I've had.  I did settle into Gnome 3 nicely for a while, but my computers continued to get older and slower.</p>
<p>Even when I upgraded my main desktop machine, I had initially only put 4G of RAM in it, and that was barely enough to be a full-time photo workstation, so I still needed to slim down my environment, so I installed XFCE on my netbooks, VMs, and desktop/server machine.</p>
<p>The <a href = "http://www.xfce.org/">XFCE environment</a> is <em>much</em> more familiar with plain window decorations, panels and widgets I can add and remove as I care, and a fixed number of multiple desktops which I can create and just keep available.  The ability to piece together the little components is what was really missing from Gnome 3. I also like to be able to customize where my panels and widgets live.  I find it more efficient to use a little space on the left and right of a wide screen for my panels instead of having them stuck to the top or bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>A convenient searching menu and launcher bound to a key combination is the last component I've really come to need these days.  I've had it on OS X, Gnome 3, Unity, and even in Windows 7.  <a href = "http://gottcode.org/xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin/">Whisker Menu</a> is an alternate menu widget for the XFCE panel that fills that need.  Add a key binding (Alt-Space for me) to fire the show-menu command, and I'm in business!</p>
<p>I added lots more RAM to my main desktop machine, but I'm still going to stick with XFCE, since it feels more native to the UNIX way &mdash; stringing together a couple small programs to get a bigger job done well.</p>
