<p>I use FriendFeed to aggregate all my content, and that echoes it out to Twitter for people who prefer to use that service to follow me.</p>
<p>I'm following many of my friends in FriendFeed, but I still need to see <em>every</em> Twitter reply without having to go check Twitter, so I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created a private FriendFeed group called <code>jflinchbaugh-twitter-replies</code>.
<li>Went to <a href = "http://search.twitter.com/">Twitter Search</a>, searched for <code><a href = "http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%40jflinchbaugh">@jflinchbaugh</a></code></li>
<li>Imported that search result page as a feed into my private group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I can just watch that group as part of my normal feed, and it shows me <em>any</em> replies within a couple hours of them being posted, and I often end up finding or creating a FriendFeed user for contacts I didn't know lived on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While playing with my twitter search feed, I noticed that my FriendFeed comments on those entries weren't echoed out to Twitter, so I just switched it to a <em>Standard</em> group, and that allows for the comments to be posted to Twitter.</p>
