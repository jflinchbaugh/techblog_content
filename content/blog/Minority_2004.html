<p>It's hard to believe, but I am in the minority.  The majority of our nation demonstrated that they'll forgive the lies, uphold limits on science, permit the ravage of nature, and continue to oppress homosexuals.  We'll continue to make enemies in the world quicker than we can invade their host countries (and then get distracted by a more profitable invasion).</p>
<p>We're all crazy, because we just don't get how this could have happened.  In the end, I'm left with the conclusion that this can't really be important, and life will just go on as it has.  We'll keep a watchful eye on our Orwellian government, cry "Conspiracy!" every once in a while, but it'll never directly affect me.  That's all we can hope, right?</p>
