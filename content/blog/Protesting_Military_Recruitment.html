<p>The US Supreme Court ruled that <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/politics/politicsspecial1/07scotus.html?hp&amp;ex=1141707600&amp;en=f7cad6649f6d188d&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">law schools receiving federal money cannot deny military recruiters access and services on campus</a>.  This includes services such as scheduling, email, and other communications.  Chief Justice Roberts went on to say that this only regulates conduct, not speech, so a school is still free to voice opposition to the military's discriminatory policies and even help students organize demonstrations.</p>
<p>The <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5248958">NPR report</a> I heard gave the example of posting protest signs right outside the room that they gave the recruiter. If they <em>are</em> sending emails and posting flyers for the recruiters, I think they should be free to include their own footers on all communications disclaiming their endorsement of this organization's discriminatory nature as well.</p>
