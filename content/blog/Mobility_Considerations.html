<p>I'm looking to replace my ThinkPad R40, so listening to <a href = "http://www.mobiletechroundup.com/?p=160">Mobile Tech Roundup 120</a> gave me a moment to consider going with a super phone or something otherwise ultra-mobile instead of a notebook.</p>
<p>I've long liked the idea of the Nokia N95, and the MoTR people made the <a href = "http://www.america.htc.com/products/advantage7501/default.html">HTC  Advantage</a> sound pretty slick. I'd also consider anything SonyEricsson smart phone.  All these phones still cost more than half of what I expect to spend on a full notebook.</p>
<p>The MoTR guys were talking about how they could get by on these devices to cover CES and do other work, but I realized that they really just needed media, browsing, writing, and networking.  My main tasks outside of browsing are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Photo editing</li>
<li>Coding (in Eclipse)</li>
<li>Video editing</li>
</ol>
<p>I unfortunately just can't do these things on a mobile platform as far as I've seen. I've been liking sitting at the dual-core desktop for photo editing, so I really look forward to a dual-core ThinkPad R61 to replace the R40.</p>
<p><a href = "http://eeepc.asus.com/global/">Asus' Eee PC</a> is intriguing, and I think I'd look into it as a network computer, but it doesn't look like it would cut it for image editing. The resolution would make Eclipse hard to use as well.  I've stuggled too long on low-res displays.</p>
