<p>I was watching TechTV's on-demand offerings yesterday and noted that they were using Mozilla for all their on-air web demos.  In particular, they used lots and lots of tabs.  This allowed them to get all their links loaded up ahead of time, and slickly switch between all the sites and links on the sites without having to wait for them to load.  Doing this with a non-tabbed browser could have been a nightmare as they tried to page through 20 separate windows on the windows task bar.</p>
