<p>I have a phone at work like most people I guess.  I despise using the telephone.  It completely ties me down and eliminates all hope of multitasking.</p>
<p>The really fun part about my work phone is that no one has the number, so no one calls me there, but invariably, at least twice a week, it rings.  I say "AOPC, This is John", and the hapless person on the other end stammers dumbly and asks for someone who's not me.  It's always a wrong number, but always for someone new.  My number must be near many other numbers in Mechanicsburg.</p>
<p>Someday, I'm going to finally start answering my phone "Hello, wrong number."</p>
