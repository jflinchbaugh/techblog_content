<p>Yesterday I watchfully allowed <code>aptitude</code> to upgrade my XFree86 to version 4.3 on my Debian Unstable laptop.  Initially, my Mach64 3D support broke, but I forced the gl/mach64 libs back into place, and it actually works again.  I really did not expect that, as there is a separate branch of the dri-mach64 stuff for XFree86 4.3.</p>
<p>For some insight on getting these things installed in the first place, <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Mach64_DRI_on_Linux_2.6">read my previous notes</a>.</p>
