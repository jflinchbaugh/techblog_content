<p>I've seen the new Quizno's Subs commercials a couple times.  The weird little mumbled song (<i>Eat Quizno's subs!</i>) sticks in my head, like I'm sure they intend.  That song also conjures the image of that little furry wad of road kill that sings the song.  When I look at it too closely or think about it too much, I just don't feel like eating anymore.</p>
<p>What were they thinking?  Marketing execs, please, just say no to drugs.</p>
