<p>Claire woke up at 2AM or so to a strange little rustling and what-not that seemed to (hopefully) be outside.  I went looking around, and glanced out the window to see the <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Whatever/p4100113">neighbor's truck ablaze</a>!  I called 911, <a href = "http://www.millersvillefire.com/">Millersville Volunteer Fire Company</a> showed up 10 minutes later to put it out, and it didn't blow up, so all is well.</p>
