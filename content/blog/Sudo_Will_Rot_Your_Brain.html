<p>Over the past couple months, I've been diligently changing root passwords and others, and shortly after I do, I end up changing them again, because I can't remember them at all.</p>
<p>Thanks to <code>sudo(8)</code> I can barely remember any of my root passwords.  I don't need it when I have <code>sudo</code>.   It keeps me from lingering logged in as root, but it seems like a dangerous trend to not remember any of the passwords.  I know when confronted with an <code>fsck</code> or something that says "login in single-user mode", I'm going to be in trouble.</p>
<p>Using openssh keys to login without passwords is sure to rot the user passwords right out of my brain as well.</p>
