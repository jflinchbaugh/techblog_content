<p>It's a slow day at work, and I'm sort of burnt out on other things, so I've switched from sawfish window manager back to metacity.  I can't remember why I even switched last time.  I'm also installing icewm and openbox to play a bit.  All 4 of these are supposed to behave nicely with gnome.</p>
<p>You Windows people don't know what your missing! ;)</p>
