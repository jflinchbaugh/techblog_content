<p>I think I'll stick with this look for a while, but I'd like some
pointers on tuning it.  I'd love to see the column of *'s set properly

for any size article content.  Right now I do it with a simple 
length/60 kind of thing to tell how many lines, but this obviously
does not accomodate using any actual formatting in my posts 
(pre tags, paragraphs, images, etc).
Anyone have any ideas?  I'm expecting a neat css trick or something.</p>
