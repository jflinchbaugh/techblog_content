<p>eBay has a list of <a href = "http://search.ebay.com/NTSA">things you should not try to take on airplanes</a> provided by the NTSA.</p>
<p>I guess you can ship/mail these things, so I must wonder why no one's started a business shipping these things home for people.  I'd think that the USPS could do quite well, if they set up a post office in the airport.  People buy collectible pointy things or Zippos and have trouble taking them home on the airplanes.</p>
