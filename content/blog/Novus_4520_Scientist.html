<p>For Christmas (or around Christmas) of 1989 (I'd be in the 7th grade), my parents gave me a <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/~glynis/novus4520/">Novus 4520 Scientist</a>* calculator made by <a href = "http://www.national.com/">National Semiconductor</a>.</p>

<p>For some reason, it sticks in my mind that they had found it at a flea market or something, maybe Green Dragon, and thought I'd like it.  I loved it!  It was the first calculator I had that did any scientific calculations at all, and I used the manual to figure out reverse polish notation and all the calculations it could do.  I had studied trigonometry a bit already, so I had some use for it to start.</p>
<p>I found another <a href = "http://www.msdsite.com/forums/upload.php?upload=zoom&amp;pid=304">picture</a> of it, though I do remember mine saying <em>National Semiconductor</em> at the top, like the first picture.  As you can see, it has the old red LED display with lenses over each digit to make them appear larger.  It came with a thick protective case, and it had a rechargeable battery pack that rattled around inside.  I'd occassionally need to open it up and resolder the battery leads when they broke loose.  Being a stupid kid, I had also found that the battery was wired directly to the plug for the power adapter, so I could stick a paper clip in there and get the clip quite hot.  It wasn't very safe.</p>
<p>Looking at other <a href = "http://www.msdsite.com/forums/upload.php?upload=view&amp;uid=482">similar calculators</a> I'm guessing this calculator was built in the USA maybe as early as 1975.  It's definitely vintage, designed before LCD.  A book** I just started reading sparked my memory of this old machine, and I realize now that I have no idea what happened to it. I'm guessing it stopped functioning (due to that battery issue or something else -- I remember seeing the inside of it often), and it was quickly replaced by a more capable modern RadioShack scientific which in turn taught me some statistics.  Eventually, I bought a TI-85 for senior year of high school.</p>
<p>Looking at all these vintage calculator sites, I'm quite tempted to bid on the 2 calculators I found on eBay -- one really is the 4520 Scientist.</p>
<p>Back about the time <a href = "http://weblogs.hjsoft.com/blojsom/blog/paige/">Paige</a> was born, I asked my Mom if they consciously did anything to encourage me to love this stuff as I do.  It was odd little things like this, I'm sure.  I wonder what I'll give Paige to set her off in various directions, and will she remember it all someday?</p>
