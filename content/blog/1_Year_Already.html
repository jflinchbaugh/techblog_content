<p>Claire and I celebrated our first full year of marriage yesterday.  Time does fly!  We modestly celebrated with lunch and a movie yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>American Wedding is a good movie.  It's better than American Pie 2.  There were many funny little things that young, recently married couples may recognize.  It was a fitting little date.</p>
<p>Along with that milestone, Paige turned 3 months old.  She celebrated by hanging out with Jami and Sean.  They have a ceiling fan, so Paige was perfectly happy.</p>
<p>Our wedding website is also still up and running for a full year of uselessness now.  Whenever I have something new and substantial for my JBoss server to run, maybe I'll replace it.  Until then, I just like to see it there.</p>
<p>And finally, the year-old wedding cake actually didn't taste terrible.  It was just a little dry.</p>
