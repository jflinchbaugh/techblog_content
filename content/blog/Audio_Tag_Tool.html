<p>I rip the Subtext and SoundCore shows from <a href = "http://www.bassdrive.com/">BassDrive</a> stream on Sunday and Monday afternoons, but their id3v2 only have the show the names and descriptions, but never the date.  I rename the files with the date, but I still can't see those file names in rhythmbox.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found <a href = "http://pwp.netcabo.pt/paol/tagtool/">Audio Tag Tool</a> and its mass tagging feature based on patterns from the filename.  I sent it running through retagging my ripped streams to include the dates from their filenames.  That's much nicer now.  I may have to run more of my files through there to get proper genres on them.</p>
