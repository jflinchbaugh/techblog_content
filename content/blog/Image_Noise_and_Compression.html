<p>My PowerShot S2 produces very noisy images at ISO 400, and I started wondering if maybe the camera could smooth some of this out for me during JPEG compression.  I usually have the camera set to super-fine quality to minimize the compression, so I cut it down to normal compression (which also cuts the image size to 1/5th  the size of the super-fine image).  The noise was still there.</p>
<p>In fact, I almost couldn't really tell a difference in the image quality of my super-fine test picture and the normal picture.  I had to go take some more test pictures in better light and really blow up the pictures to notice the slightest change in image sharpness.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I'm still opting to shoot the images at super-fine, since I have plenty of SD cards (2G).  Letting Gimp compress them down in post-processing seems to get the pictures to be almost the same size, but preserves more detail.  The slightly higher quality seems to also keep the detail through the <a href = "http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Selective_Gaussian_Blur/">noise reduction</a> method I use.</p>
