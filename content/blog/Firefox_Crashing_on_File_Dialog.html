<p>I've been seeing Firefox of various 1.5 versions in Debian unstable crashing upon trying to open any file dialog.  Per <a href = "http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=348470">a bug report</a>, I tried switching themes GTK/Gnome themes from my normal SphereCrystal to another, Glider, and now it's fixed.  You can imagine how  frustrating it's been to have Firefox unable to save any downloads for the past month or so.</p>
