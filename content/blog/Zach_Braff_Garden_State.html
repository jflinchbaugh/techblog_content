<p>I find the most interesting things clicking through Google referers here.  It seems that Zach Braff, star of Scrubs, has written, directed, and stars in a movie called <a href = "http://gardenstate.typepad.com/">Garden State</a>.  I'm interested in seeing what this movie is.  The story looks like it could be interesting.  The music, teaser trailer, and story description make it look like one of those artsy movies I love so much.</p>
