<p>Yesterday, I added a couple 1-hour podcasts to my W810i and dropped them into a playlist.  When I tried to play it, it just said "Failed", and shutdown the player.  After that I couldn't even open the player with the Walkman button -- it just said "Failed" again and slowly went back to the standby screen.</p>
<p>Restarting didn't help, removing the files didn't help, and removing the card didn't help.  Finally, I managed to get into the Walkman player mode through the main menu which doesn't go right to the current playlist.  From the Walkman menu, I could select another song and get it playing again.</p>
<p>In the end, I found that selecting the playlist again would cause the failure, so I deleted the playlist and rebuilt it.  All is well now.  The playlist must have gotten corrupted somehow when I was manipulating it.</p>
