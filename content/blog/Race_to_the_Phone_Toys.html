<p>I've ordered a small pile of toys and accessories for my T616, including little things to flash when the phone rings, a charger, horizontal pouch case, and the camera phone flash.  Since ordering these things, I've also increased the frequency with which I drop the damn thing on the pavement.  With purchasing all the toys, I've acknowledged that I'll keep the phone for a while, but I fear the phone will not survive long enough to see the toys at this rate.</p>
