<p>My New Year's Eve was great.  I slept in just a little, then ran around downtown Lancaster with Claire and Paige for lunch and most of the afternoon.  We wandered the farmers' market, Hagar Arcade (upscale shops), Queen Street shops, Chestnut Books.</p>

<p>We didn't really buy much beyond lunch, but it was nice to wander.  It was actually nice enough that we could just sit on a bench and eat outside. It was nice to get downtown again.  I've missed my days being near things working in downtown Lancaster.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we just stayed home for the night.  It was nice and relaxing.</p>
