<p>It looks like <a href = "http://leo.typepad.com/tlr/2004/04/end_of_line.html#0001147717">Leo is done with TechTV</a>.  He had decided earlier to leave <a href = "http://www.techtv.com/screensavers">ScreenSavers</a> and continue doing <a href = "http://www.techtv.com/callforhelp/">Call for Help</a>, but now the outgoing TechTV owners have gotten rid of him when he wouldn't sign over his share of the network.</p>
<p>I think Vulcan (the owner) has really just sabotaged the value of the network a bit for Comcast.  That's too bad.  With some luck, Comcast will get this whole transition right, and invite Leo back to the new network.</p>
<p>It really won't be the same without him.  I made a point to watch every on-demand show that Leo hosted, since they were guaranteed to be interesting.  He had expected to make guest appearances on ScreenSavers specials, which would have been great, since those are the shows they offer on-demand.  I guess not anymore.</p>
