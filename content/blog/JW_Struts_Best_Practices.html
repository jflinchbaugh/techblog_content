<p>JavaWorld has an <a href = "http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2004/jw-0913-struts.html">Struts Best Practices</a> article which I'd just like to note here, so I can get back to it when I have a moment.</p>
<p>I still struggle with Struts on occassion, and there are certain tasks I avoid, because I don't know how to do it in Struts.  I have occassional break-throughs, though, like when I figured out that I should just implement my own CoR framework instead of trying to cram it into a chain of Struts actions.
I look forward to a re-release of Struts 1.2.x, so maybe I can try Struts-Chain instead and maybe absorb more of the framework's concepts.  I still have yet to even play with the validator.</p>
