<p>It seems that letting the battery die on my Sony Ericsson S710a is a bad idea.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it can be a problem.  I have the phone checking a POP3 account every 5 minutes.  I think it was probably actively checking when the battery gave up on 2 seperate occassions.</p>
<p>When I power the phone back on, that primary email account is corrupted in that the settings are mostly blank, and I cannot get it to save the settings back.  I end up needing to delete the account and completely recreating it from scratch.  I think I'll be more careful about the battery, since tapping out all those settings on the keypad is time-consuming, and it sometimes takes me a day to realize that the email hasn't been checking.</p>
