<p>Response times of the JBoss server were lagging a bit and the swapping was high with the <a href = " http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Trying_CMS_Garbage_Collection">CMS GC settings</a>, so I'm back to the throughput collector (-XX:+UseParallelGC).  I get occassional long pauses, but most the time, it's responding pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Here are my latest settings in my small environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>-server -Xms44m -Xmx44m -XX:ThreadStackSize=96 -Xss96k -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -verbose:gc -XX:-TraceClassUnloading</code></p>
