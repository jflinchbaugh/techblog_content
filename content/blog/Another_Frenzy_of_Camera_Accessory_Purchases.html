<p>I have a small pile of gear on its way, and it's taking forever to arrive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flash bracket frame thing (maybe to modify)</li>
<li>CTR-301 radio/optical slaves (last effort before buying PocketWizards)</li>
<li>Bamboo Fun Wacom Tablet</li>
<li>Macro Extension Tubes (the best quality air $10-$60 can buy)</li>
</ul>

<p>In that mess, I have a shiny new ASUS eeePC 1000HE netbook for Claire arriving some day as well.  It'll be nice to have a new Linux machine, but I'll need to figure out how to install Ubuntu from an SD card.  That should be exciting.</p>
<p>I don't know how people stand online shopping for everything.  With the closing of Circuit City, etc, we'll just need to order more and more stuff online and wait for delivery.  I have a theory that getting enough stuff constantly in flight (go economy!) will keep a steady stream of interesting toys, and it'll save me the anxiety of waiting for stuff.</p>
