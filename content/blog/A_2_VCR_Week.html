<p>PBS will air NOVA's <a href = "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/">Origins</a> beginning tonight and concluding tomorrow.  Presidential debates begin tomorrow night as well.  I'll not be home to see any of the overlapping programs.</p>
<p>The occassional TV dilemma may inspire me to actually look into digital video stuff.  In particular, our most common problem is going out and  forgetting to tape the few shows we actually watch.  It seems to me that this application could be solved with a TV tuner card, the usual command-line video capture tools, and a nice little WAP interface.  Then when I remember that I wanted to tape something, I just point my phone at the WAP interface over the internet, set the channel, and start recording.  I can playback with a wireless notebook temporarily plugged into the TV.  I could eventually develop a real solution.</p>
