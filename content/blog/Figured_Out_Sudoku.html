<p>I loaded the little <a href = "http://www.getjar.com/products/2603/SUDOKUSpot">Sudoku Spot</a> JavaME game on my phone a long time ago, then wiped it, because I couldn't figure out a strategy to play. <a href = "http://weblogs.hjsoft.com/blojsom/blog/bryn/">Bryn</a> recently expressed interest in getting a Sudoku game loaded on her phone, so I suggested this one, since it had a better interface than any of the others that I had seen.</p>
<p>I figured I'd load it myself again, and see if I could figure it out, and this time, it clicked, so I finally figured out the strategy for this game.  I've actually completed a few boards.</p>
<p>Now I just need to figure out how to get the Linux bluetooth stuff to push Java applications to the Motorola V551/V557.  I did find that I can put the jar in the <em>Other</em> directory on my SonyEricsson S710a, and I can push it from there to other phones, including the Motorola phones.</p>
