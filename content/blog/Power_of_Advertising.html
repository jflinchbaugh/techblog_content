<p>The marketing people really seem to know how to get my attention these days.  I see so many billboards on my drive with 10-foot tall burgers, subs, etc.  By the time I get to work all I want is a 10-foot burger, and a 20-foot Pepsi!</p>
<p>Oddly, I always miss the directions to find the places with the 10-foot food.  That's probably for the best -- normal food is usually large enough.</p>
