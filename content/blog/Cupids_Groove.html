<p>I actually got out to see <a href = "http://www.djmicro.com/">Micro</a> at 
<a href = "http://www.dragonflyclub.com/">Dragonfly</a> in Harrisburg on Friday night.  I got in at about 11pm to find a decent turnout and left at about 1am.</p>
<p>I heard mostly Psyche and Micro.  The music was great, and I found I could still dance, and quite a lot at that.  It's been a long time, since I've felt the energy to just stay out on the dance floor for a majority of the night.  It really was great, so I'll have to keep up and get out to the <a href = "http://yard.hjsoft.com/">next parties</a> in my area.</p>
