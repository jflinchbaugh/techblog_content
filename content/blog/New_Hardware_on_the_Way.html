<p>My ThinkPad has twice now started spewing hard drive errors.  This is the 40G drive that IBM sent me nearly 3 years ago to replace the original drive.  The <em>third</em> drive in this notebook will be an 80G drive from Toshiba.</p>
<p>While I was ordering the emergency replacement drive at NewEgg, I decided to pick up the other things I'd been wanting.  This includes an IDE-to-USB adapter cable to make troubleshooting and drive migration easier when I get the new drive.  I also picked up a SimpleTech 500GB NAS to replace the old Pentium 200 backup machine.  That should be much quieter and power-efficient, not to mention a huge amount of storage.  With the addition of an external USB drive or two, I can expand this thing well beyond a terabyte.</p>
<p>Finally, I stumbled upon a 20.1" widescreen LCD from Sceptre as a super-discounted open-box special, so I picked that up to replace the old CRT in the office.  That should also help keep the office cooler.</p>
