<p>In my work code, I had learned to very meticulously close all my JMS resources just to be sure they didn't hang around too long.  In the first pass of some code, I had neglected this, but felt no repercussions.</p>
<p>I had not gotten around to applying the same wisdom to my personal blog code, and felt the wrath of the thread limit pretty quickly.  It seems that in JBoss, every <code>QueueSender</code>, <code>QueueSession</code>, and <code>QueueConnection</code> spawns Read and Write Tasks with their own threads, and they just hang around with established connections (as verified with <code>netstat</code>).  I'm sure the garbage collector would have cleaned these all up eventually, but they were coming too fast (one message per each HTTP request), and they quickly piled up.</p>
<p>I first saw the issue manifest itself as a <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</code> due to its inability to spawn more than the 256 maximum threads as set by <code>ulimit</code>.  A bit later, errors about "too many open files" start popping up as well.  At first, I figured I may just need more threads, but as a classic resource leak goes, bumping up to 512 threads just made it take a little longer to hit the limit again.</p>
<p>Once I got my resources closing, I watched my thread count bounce around the 87-95.  That's much better.</p>
