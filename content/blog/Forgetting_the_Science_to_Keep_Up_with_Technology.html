<p>I've spent the morning reading (and blogging), and I've only found that all the things I'm learning are just leading to more questions and the need to learn even more.  I feel as if I've been ignoring the some of the higher thought processes of software design just to chase the low-level details of the latest technology.</p>

<p>It started out with reading about "<a href = "http://nat.truemesh.com/archives/000316.html">Refuctoring</a>", which led me to wonder why you'd really need a tool to refactor code.  Via a short excursion into <a href = "http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans</a> IDE (which I've had on my disk for a while), I landed at Joshua Kerievsky's <a href = "http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/catalog.html">Refactoring to Patterns Catalog</a> based on the book.</p>
<p>I was still just trying to figure out what could be so complex that it couldn't be done by hand.  I recognized some of the ideas in the catalog, while others seemed loftier, but useful if I elevate my code to those stronger designs.  I doubt a tool could really introduce most of the more thoughtful patterns.</p>
<p>When I was still studying the mechanisms of J2EE, I read the J2EE Patterns book, but I've realized that much of it went over my head at the time.  I need to go back and reread it now that I have a strong basis.</p>
<p>Now it seems I need to step back even further and refresh my knowledge of non-enterprise patterns as well.  As I tried to adapt to the less object-oriented EJB interfaces, I abandoned much of the benefits of object-oriented code.  I didn't realize that the whole OO system still exists underneath the EJB and behind the servlet.  Roller code opened my eyes to this recently as well.  I code so simply on the complex J2EE platform, and it's keeping my code from being reusable.  I'm tempted to buy this <i>Refactoring to Patterns</i> book, but I still never get around to reading everything in my list.</p>
