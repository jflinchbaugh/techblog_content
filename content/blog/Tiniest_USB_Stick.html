<p>I made the tiniest USB drive for my car using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HGFKR8?ie=UTF8&tag=johnflinswebl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002HGFKR8">elago microSD card reader</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L1H0SC?ie=UTF8&tag=johnflinswebl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001L1H0SC">16G microSD card</a>&mdash;it's more of USB nub than a stick, but it's big enough to hold my entire music collection I've collected over the years.  The USB port on the new Fiesta is in the middle console out in the open, so I wanted the smallest device for it, so it wouldn't be damaged.</p>
