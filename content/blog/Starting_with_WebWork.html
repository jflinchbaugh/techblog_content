<p>I started looking over <a href = "http://struts.apache.org/struts-shale/index.html">Struts Shale</a>, but something about <a href = "http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/">WebWork</a> is instead attracting my attention.  I think the promise of Struts Action 2 being based on WebWork and its familiarity over the new JSF paradigm is what's making me swing that direction.</p>
<p>I admit that it may be more progressive to look toward JSF, but I'm just putting it off at this point.  Maybe a few stumbles with WebWork will send me back to explore JSF.</p>
<p>Only one conclusion can be derived at this point:  I'll eternally spend more time studying a framework than productively coding on an older familiar framework.</p>
