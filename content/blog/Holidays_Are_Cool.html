<p>For a bit there, my job afforded me the opportunity to forget how cool these little one-off holidays are.  I'm supposed to get 13 holidays per year, but last year I ended up working through many of them.  This year is shaping up to be better.</p>
<p>Having a holiday to myself (since Claire didn't take the day off) wasn't so bad.  I got to sleep a bit, sat at the computer for extended periods, then played with Paige for a bit in the afternoon.</p>
<p>My major accomplishment has been to catch up on ALL my video editing.  I wasn't as picky this time about editing, since I had a huge backload.  I had about 25 minutes sitting on the computer since the beginning of December, and I had another 40 minutes on the camera waiting to be dumped.  I went through it all, broke it into separate little movies, encoded it to VCD mpeg, and uploaded it all to the gallery.  My plate is clean!</p>
<p>Now I can go back to video taping Paige like a fanatic.  If you want to see the videos, they are spread around a bit.  Most can be found in the <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Paige_Marie_Flinchbaugh">Paige</a> 6- to 8-month galleries, and under <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/gallery/Family_Christmas_2003">Christmas 2003</a>.</p>
