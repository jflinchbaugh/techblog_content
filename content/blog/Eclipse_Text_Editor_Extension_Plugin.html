<p>I've been ripping through lots of code refactoring and cleaning, so I've been dying to script up a few of these basic text manipulations, but Eclipse doesn't really have much to help there.  I went searching, and found the <a href = "http://eclipseexeditor.sourceforge.net/index.html">Eclipse Text Editor Extension</a> plugin.  It's really basic, but its most useful feature is the "Filter..." functionality.  It lets you select a chunk of code, and run any shell commands on that code as a  filter.</p>
<p>This is great!  It opens up all sorts of possibilities which you'd have using <em>lesser</em> plain text editors like <code>vi</code>.</p>
<p>My first application of this excellent little plugin was to hack up a quick little Perl script to wrap SQL code in Java string literals.  I've been doing lots of this by hand, but no more!  <a href = "http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> and some PATH hacking make this especially useful on Windows.</p>
<p>I've recently begun recognizing the value of shortcut keys, so I'm pleased to see that I can quickly get to the filter dialog by pressing Alt-Shift-|(pipe).</p>
