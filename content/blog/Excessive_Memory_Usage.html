<p>My notebook seems to be hurting for more memory, but I'm not sure what's causing it.  I can see memory usage of everything, but I don't know what the usages were previously.  I've recently started working with Webwork and EJB3, but I do regular upgrades of everything else, so it could be anything.</p>
<p>Between JBoss, latest Eclipse, Gnome, etc, the 512M is being eaten up.   Rhythmbox is pretty high on the list as well.  I'm going to try dropping jPodder for a lighter podcatcher, hpodder, and see if it makes a difference.  It seems obscene to install more memory in a Linux notebook.  It's supposed to be all efficient, the savior of older hardware.</p>
<p>Since I've recently found that I can run JBoss out of PermGen space, I'm afraid it's Webwork and/or EJB3.  This is going to be painful when I try to deploy my new application to the less-resourceful production server.</p>
