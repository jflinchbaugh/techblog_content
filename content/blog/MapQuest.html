<p>In the next week, I'll be leaving my current job and going to work with <a href = "http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> (via <a href = "http://www.teksystems.com/">TEKsystems</a>).  They use Java, and they have an office within 5 miles of my house.  It'll be nice to be done commuting 90 miles each day.</p>
