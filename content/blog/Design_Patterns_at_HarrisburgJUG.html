<p>On Thursday, 21 April, at 6:30pm, I'll be presenting an introduction to Design Patterns featuring Template Method, Strategy, Command, and Factory Method patterns to the <a href = "http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harrisburgjug/">HarrisburgJUG</a> at <a href = "http://www.perfectorder.com/index.php?about_directions">Perfect Order</a> in Mechanicsburg.</p>
<p>My source books will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href = "http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0201633612">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href = "http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=368">Holub on Patterns: Learning Design Patterns by Looking at Code</a>
</li>
<li><a href = "http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/index.html">Core J2EE Patterns</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone should come out and offer your support, bring some questions, and help me survive this thing! (*panic*)  Even if you favor other programming languages, this stuff is still useful -- I just won't be providing you sample code (but my source books do).</p>
