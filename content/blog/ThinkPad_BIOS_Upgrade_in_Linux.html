<p>I successfully updated the BIOS on my ThinkPad R40 completely from within Linux -- I didn't even need the ultrabay floppy I bought to do this last time.  I used the <a href = "http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_Upgrade">instructions at ThinkWiki</a> to extract the image from the non-diskette EXE, create a bootable CD image, and burn it.  After that, it just booted the CD on the notebook.  I don't know why I couldn't have figured that out <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/ThinkPad_BIOS_Upgrade">last time</a>.</p>
