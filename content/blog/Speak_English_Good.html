<p><em>Ack!</em> I can barely bring myself to use that title!  Anyway, here's a great link detailing <a href = "http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~brians/errors/errors.html">Common Errors in English</a>.  There are so many curious little corrections, clarifications, and recommendations here.  It should provide for at least an hour or two of not-so-wasted wasting of time.</p>
<p>I pride myself on my language skills, but I'm always curious to find proper documentation and details of the rules I use.  One particular surprise was the demise of my "no ending sentences with prepositions" rule to a <a href = "http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~brians/errors/nonerrors.html#preposition">non-error</a>.  A link from there seems to strike a nice <a href = "http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Writing/p.html#prepend">middle ground</a> with which I can be comfortable. (or...<em>can be comfortable with.</em> *whimper* *breathe* *breathe*).  I think I may just need to stick with it except in places where my the fake rule necessitates grammatical acrobatics ("This is the sort of English up with which I will not put.")</p>
<p>This has been the most grammar-conscious I've been in any of my articles, because I know everyone will start picking it apart now.</p>
