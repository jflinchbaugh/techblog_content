<p><a href = "http://www.dailygizwiz.com/">Dick DeBartolo</a> and Leo Laporte have been on the set of <a href = "http://www.callforhelptv.com/">Call For Help</a> this past week, and they've been doing their podcasts from the set and from local restaurants in Toronto.  They really seem to be having fun, especially now that they're in the same city.  It sounds like they've been running around the show set like mischievous children.</p>
