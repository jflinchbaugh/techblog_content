<p>Claire and I took turns deleting stuff off the DVR the other night.  We hacked it down from about 60% to less than 20%!</p>
<p>One of the largest chunks of disk was occupied by most every episode of <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/coupling/">Coupling</a> recorded from <a href = "http://www.bbcamerica.com/">BBC America</a>.  I finally can delete them, since Claire just bought me the entire series on DVD for my birthday!  The show is  hilarious, but no longer in production.  I've shown it to a couple friends already, but I'll be more than willing to screen more episodes with anyone who's interested.</p>
