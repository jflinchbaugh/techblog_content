<p>Comcast has select shows from <a href = "http://www.techtv.com/">TechTV</a> available through their on-demand service.</p>
<p>It's amazing how useful and interesting their programming can be.  It's not just about gaming.  They cover lots of future technology like solar-powered water taxis, critter-cam, and all sorts of various new gadgets.  They even had a very impressive <a href = "http://www.techtv.com/freshgear/shownotes/story/0,23008,3445335,00.html">Star Trek apartment</a>.  I'm pleased, but I still wouldn't mind a full 24-hr channel.</p>
