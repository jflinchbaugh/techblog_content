<p>I just got my first <a href = "http://www.cingular.com/">Cingular</a> bill, since switching from the old AT&amp;T Wireless and using my new Sony Ericsson S710a.  The bill was 44 pages, due mostly to my data usage.  Besides my active bandwidth usage, my phone is configured to check an IMAP mailbox every 30 minutes.  Initially I had the interval set to 5 minutes!</p>
<p>As I'm not likely to cut my connection frequency further, I should probably switch to paperless billing.  For trivia's sake, I'll say all those pages still only totalled to 56M of data.  It was pretty easy to consume that much with the faster EDGE network.</p>
