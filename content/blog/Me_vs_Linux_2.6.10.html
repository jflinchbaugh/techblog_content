<p>I installed the 2.6.10 <a href = "http://www.kernel.org/">kernel</a> a while back and had nothing but trouble.  After a suspend to disk (swsusp) and resume, my ThinkPad R40's <a href = "http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=110424560708210&amp;w=2">e100 network interface failed</a>.
I eventually got advice to try 
<a href = "http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=110469150921035&amp;w=2">pci=routeirq</a>, and that corrected that issue for me.  It supposedly helps USB, as well, but I wasn't using that so much.  Ultimately, a 
<a href = "http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=110476483012015&amp;w=2">swsusp patch</a> was figured out, and should fix it all, so I won't need the <code>pci=routeirq</code> option.
</p>
<p>My <a href = "http://ipw2100.sf.net/">IPW2100 wireless NIC</a> also failed, but there's a <a href = "http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6233170&amp;forum_id=38938">patch for that</a> as well.</p>
<p>All this talk of proper IRQ handling and such got me thinking about my mysterious lockup issue as well.  Occassionally, after waking from swsusp, my notebook hard locks, and I have to punch the power button.  I'm playing with the <code>acpi=noirq</code> option to see if that alleviates the problem.  I'm hopeful that maybe these recent swsusp patches could fix it as well.</p>
