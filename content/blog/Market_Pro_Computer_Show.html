<p>I went to the Market Pro show today to look around and pick up a network switch.  It was the big "super sale" in Harrisburg which actually went Saturday 9-9 and Sunday 9-5.  I thought to myself, "This must be a great show -- It's huge!"  It wasn't.  It was mostly crap.  The actual area with computer vendors was about half what it was back in the day, and the rest was of no interest -- clothes, jewelry, car audio, etc.</p>
<p>It was a terrible disappointment.  On top of the $10 discounted admission for Claire, Paige, and I, we ended up paying $5 for parking.  That's $15 right up front, and I didn't even have any hardware yet!  I found exactly the same prices I would have online, but not near the selection.  I ended up buying a mere 10/100 hub instead of a switch, because the day had started out costing me too much.  It was a huge waste of time.  I'm never going to bother going again.  I can go to Cyber Warehouse, pay more, but still save time and money considering it all.  Oh well, Market Pro's day has come and gone.</p>
