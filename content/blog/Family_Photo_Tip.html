<p>I've recently been browsing friends' photos of their kids, and I have a favorite photo tip to share:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before you snap that picture of your kid, get down on their <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery/Children_2007-02/IMG_4105">level</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I often just sit down to take a picture, and occasionally I'll get <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery/Children_2007-01/IMG_3292">even lower</a> by sitting the camera nearly on the ground.  Shooting <em>up</em> or at least level has the added benefit of showing less of the <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery/Children_2007-02/IMG_4187">clutter</a> that's always on the floor when their playing.</p>
<p>(Now go check your server logs and see if I was looking at your photos!)</p>
