<p><a href = "http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a> has a new little <a href = "http://java.sun.com/developer/Quizzes/ejb/applyingejb.html">EJB quiz</a> online.  I only scored 60% (9/15).  That's sort of disappointing.  I should know this stuff better, but I've just not taken the time to idly read the specs, and I've not had the opportunity to use these things yet.  I'm falling behind.</p>
<p>At least I'm better at coding EJBs than <a href = "https://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Serial_Killer_Language_Inventor">spotting serial killers</a>.</p>
