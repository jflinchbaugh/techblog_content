<p>Call it prophecy fulfillment or whatever, but I crashed my Gentoo box doing a glibc upgrade, so I won't have to wait as long as I had hoped to try out my <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/DVD_Burner">DVD Burner</a>.</p>
<p>It's sitting there now stuck after having tried to run <code>init</code>, so I'll burn a new Gentoo CD, see if I can figure out how to repair it.  If it gets too complicated, I'll put Debian on it, and be done.  I did get a run of 320-some days out of it, before accidently killing it.</p>
