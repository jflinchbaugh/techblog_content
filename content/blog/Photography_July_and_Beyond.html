<p>While preparing for last night's <a href = "http://flickr.com/groups/nofear/">No Fear Photography</a> meeting, I realized that I've had a pretty exciting month of photography!</p>
<ul>
<li>As Independence Day approached, I realized I didn't care a thing for trying to take some fireworks photos, but we still stumbled upon some, and I happened to get a <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Trips/2008-07-04_Camping_Muddy_Run/DSC_8906_01.jpg.html">fireworks photo</a> or 2 that I actually liked.</li>
<li>I got away with taking <em>all</em> my gear on the beach vacation -- flashes, umbrella, lenses, foam and poster board reflectors, everything!  The monopod bungeed to a chair or railing makes a great lightweight light stand.</li>
<li>I crudded up my sensor pretty badly on vacation, and ended up learning: 1) small apertures show dust really well, 2) to clone out lots of dust spots in post-processing, and 3) how to clean the sensor with a blower, swab, and Eclipse fluid.</li>
<li>I managed to shoot a few strobist-style shots of the <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Trips/2008-07_Stone_Harbor/DSC_11134_01.jpg.html">family on vacation</a> -- they played while I setup, then I shot for 10 minutes or so.  Then we abruptly tossed all the gear in the van and ran off, because someone needed to hit the bathroom.</li>
<li>I passed off my D40 and 50mm f/1.8 crammed into a too-small bag as a point-and-shoot, so I got it into the <a href = "http://gallery.hjsoft.com/gallery2/v/Concerts/2008-08-08_Kill_Hannah/">Kill Hannah show at Chameleon</a>.</li>
<li>Upon acquiring a super-cheap Sigma 70-300DG lens which only focuses manually on my D40 and a few other accessories, I've acknowledged that I have all the gear I need for now, and that opinion has stuck for nearly a month now.  300mm fits my needs nicely, and I seldom wish I had "just a little more".</li>
<li>I've actually started shedding gear -- Stacey's borrowing my Nikkor 55-200VR lens which was effectively replaced with the 70-300.  If she doesn't buy it, maybe someone else will.</li>
<li>I'm having lots of fun shooting close-up shots with the Sigma lens.</li>
<li>After about a month of shooting almost exclusively with the 70-300, I went back to my kit 18-55mm lens a bit to shoot some wide-angle -- I'm particularly enjoying wide landscapes and a bit of distortion in portraits.</li>
<li>My manual-everything 50mm f/1.8 remains my go-to lens for parties, low-light, and street photography.</li> 
<li>I was looking at the Fall non-credit photography courses at <a href = "http://hacc.edu/">HACC</a> and trying to choose 1 of 2 possible classes.  Today, I just registered for both, instead of trying to choose: <a href = "https://vc.hacc.edu/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.coursedetail&amp;coursecode=CACE138">Portrait Photography</a> and <a href = "https://vc.hacc.edu/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.coursedetail&amp;coursecode=PHOTCE758">Perfect Pictures</a>.</li>
</ul>
