<p>Back in the middle of January, the whole family (with my parents) took a vacation to Disney World in Florida.  We spent a week there, had a great time, and we <em>ate</em> very well.</p>
<p>We went back to EPCOT for dinner a couple times, so we needed the park-hopper tickets to allow us to switch parks at dinner time.</p>
<p>Here are some of the restaurants we visited in order of my preference:</p>

Lunch at <a href = "http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/animal-kingdom/dining/tusker-house/">Tusker House</a> (Animal Kingdom/Africa) -- buffet with a wide variety regional dishes to try. (I remember this being very veggie friendly.)

Dinner at <a href = "http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/epcot/dining/restaurant-marrakesh/">Marrakesh</a> (EPCOT/Morocco) -- <strong>beautiful</strong> restaurant with interesting Moroccan food I've not had previously -- we split the expensive "feast" sampler and an appetizer, so we could try lots of different things.  While I may not really like Moroccan food, it was an awesome experience.

Lunch at the quick burrito/taco place, La Cantina, in EPCOT/Mexico.

<a href = "http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/epcot/dining/le-celier-steakhouse/">Le Cellier Steakhouse</a> (EPCOT/Canada) had excellent food <em>and</em> beer. I had the Trois di Pistoles from Canada's own Unibroue brewery.</li>

Pooh character breakfast (buffet) at <a href = "http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/magic-kingdom/dining/the-crystal-palace/">Crystal Palace</a> in Magic Kingdom.

For Italian, Mama Melrose in Hollywood Studios was better than Tony's in Magic Kingdom.

Norway's restaurant with the princess was only <em>OK</em>.  The authentic Norwegian dish amounts to a meat loaf, and the appetizer buffet wasn't very extensive.

I also drank my way half way around the world, but I sort of ran out of time on that endeavor.</p>
<p>My parents made all the dinner reservations, some 2 months in advance (Le Cellier) and some 9 hours: (407) WDWÂ–DINE takes care of all that.</p>
