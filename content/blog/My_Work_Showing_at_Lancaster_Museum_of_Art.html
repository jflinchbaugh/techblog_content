<p>The <a href = "http://www.lmapa.org/exhibits/lancaster_lens/">Lancaster Lens</a> photography exhibit is going on right now at the Lancaster Museum of Art.  I'm one of the featured artists there showing <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/photos/jflinchbaugh/sets/72157628228565839/">6 of my toy images</a>.</p>
<p>It's an incredible opportunity for me, and I still can't quite believe I have working showing in a museum, so stop by and support photography and the arts in Lancaster, PA.</p>
