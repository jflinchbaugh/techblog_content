<p>Referring back to my <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Using_Bluetooth">previous notes</a> on configuring my DBT-120 bluetooth dongle, I got it working on my new ThinkPad R40.  Either Debian or Knoppix had dropped some default example PPP configs into /etc, so it already had a GPRS example.  With that example and my notes, I got it working within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I saw my USB dongle for sale at OfficeMax for $40.  I got mine off EBay  for $17 -- pretty good.</p>
