<p>I'm currently in the middle of reading Roberto Valenzuela's <em>Picture Perfect Practice</em>, and I'm really enjoying it.  The book offers lots of simple exercises for photographers, and I'd like to get out and try more of them than I have, so I invite everyone to join me and practice a bit as well.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, 17 November 2012, 12-4pm</strong>, I'd like to lead a photowalk in Lancaster, PA, starting at Binn's Park.  I'll bring some select exercises, explain them quickly, and then we'll hit the street in search of light, geometry, and other concepts in photography.

If you want to read ahead, I bought it in an open ebook format straight from <a href = "http://www.peachpit.com/store/picture-perfect-practice-a-self-training-guide-to-mastering-9780321803535">Peachpit</a>.
