<p>I've finally purchased a VPS plan from <a href = "http://www.easyco.com/">EasyCo</a>.  I have it all updated to Debian Unstable, and it seems to be working fine.  I have 256M memory and 4G of disk.  Oddly, they split the 256M across 128M RAM and 128M swap on a tmpfs, so it's still in memory.  I'm not sure what he point of that is, except maybe it allows them to swap out some of my stuff while under heavy load.  I'm not sure.  They say they don't overcommit the machines.</p>
<p>I've moved my mail relays and DNS.  I'm just waiting for <a href = "http://www.dotster.com/">Dotster</a> to move my nameserver records to the new IP.  <a href = "http://x.hjsoft.com/">Lynn</a> should be relieved of the responsibilities this evening I'm hoping.  He's been running stuff for me for the past couple years after I lost my static DSL.</p>
<p>I have JBoss 4.0.0 running on the VPS, but it wouldn't run under J2SDK 5.0.  I could get a "minimal" server running, but "default" would never complete its startup.  It just sends a java thread spinning off at 99% CPU while trying to start the embedded Tomcat 5.0 instance (I think).  JBoss 3.2.6 acted similarly, so I had to drop back to J2SDK 1.4.2_06.  Not being able to use J2SDK 5.0 will be a huge disappointment.  It must be a problem interacting with the user-mode Linux, since I've seen it work fine on my other native Intel machines.  I'm not even sure where to begin on trying to debug and report it as a bug.</p>
<p>In my own local testing, JBoss 4.0.0 and J2SDK 5.0 locked the 2.4.26-3um kernel.  EasyCo's 2.4.26-2um doesn't lock, but it's obviously not completely working.</p>
