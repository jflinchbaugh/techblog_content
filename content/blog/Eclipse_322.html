<p><a href = "http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/readme_eclipse_3.2.2.html">Eclipse 3.2.2</a> came out, and so far, I've observed that it's stopped prompting me to install the same update every day.  That's great.</p>
<p>Now I'm hoping that I'll see if it fix the issue with some tab bars disappearing on my Windows XP workstation.</p>
<p><strong>Update (3:30pm):</strong> The tab bar still disappears. ;(</p>
