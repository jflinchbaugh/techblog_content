<p>After <i>Matrix: Reloaded</i>, I'm not really sure the movie people deserve my $8, but the power of the first movie carries right through, and I just <b>must</b> see if this final movie does the first any justice -- the second didn't.</p>
<p>I'm so frustrated that they're going to get my money, and there's just not much I can do about it.  I haven't seen it yet, but I really don't expect much.</p>
