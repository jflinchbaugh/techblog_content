<p>I've had my little <a href = "http://weblogs.hjsoft.com/blojsom/blog/john/">
mobile weblog</a> for a couple years, but its functionality is relatively limited, so I'm looking for more.</p>
<p>I've become a bit of a <em>joiner</em> recently, and I've joined a few services, including <a href = "http://www.groovr.com/user/jflinchbaugh/">Groovr</a>, <a href = "http://twitter.com/jflinchbaugh">Twitter</a>, and most recently <a href = "http://flickr.com/photos/jflinchbaugh/">Flickr</a>.  I figure I have my normal weblog for longer-form articles and a repository for my more important thoughts, but I could use Twitter and Flickr for the <em>micro</em> stuff.</p>
<p>I don't want to be splattered all over the internet like some of people I know, so I need a way to pull this all back together into one place -- one stream.  If I'm posting on Twitter and Flickr at about the same time, then it's likely the photos and text are related and should be presented together.</p>
<p>How do I integrate these?  Or should I be looking at another service?  Groovr wasn't quite it, but could be some day.</p>
<p>I'm also not sure how important the social aspect is to me.  It's awfully amusing to watch certain people within these networks, but am I really contributing anything back to these networks?  Probably not so much.  I must have at least a bit of an exhibitionist thing, though, since I want to post this stuff at all.</p>
