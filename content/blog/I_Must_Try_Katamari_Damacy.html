<p>I've recently <a href = "http://www.blojsom.com/blog/general/2005/01/05/On_Katamari_Damacy.html">read about a game</a> called <a href = "http://www.namco.com/games/katamari_damacy/">Katamari Damacy</a>.  You apparently just roll this ball of stuff around and make it grow as things stick to it, so the controls sound dead simple.  That's good for me, because complicated controls are one of the things that have really turned me off to gaming.</p>
<p>Now I need to convince one of my PS2-toting friends to go buy this game or join GameFly or something.  None of the local Blockbuster stores seem to have it.  Who's interested?</p>
