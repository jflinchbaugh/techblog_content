<p>Between work and the Harrisburg JUG meeting, I wandered out to <a href = "http://weblogs.hjsoft.com/blojsom/blog/john/2005/03/15/Uh_oh.html">Best Buy</a> to blow a gift card I've had since Christmas.  I came home with a Sony DVD+-RW with dual layer capability and all that (and a rebate to mail, of course).</p>

<p>Currently, my 2 computers in which I could install this thing have uptimes of 190 days and 300+ days, so I don't think I'll go rebooting any computers just yet to install this thing.  I figure it'll be my consolation prize when one of the machines goes down.</p>
<p>I want to burn DVDs for my off-site backups (2 DVD-RWs instead of 9 CD-RWs), so it could be advisable to put the burner in the machine that actually houses the backups, a P5-200Mhz.  I'm really curious to see if it works in there.  On one hand, the drives suggests a P4-1.6Ghz(!?), but really, how hard could it be to stream a UDF image on the fly  from a local SCSI filesystem to an IDE burner?  The data is already compressed.  Maybe I'll have a chance to find out.</p>
