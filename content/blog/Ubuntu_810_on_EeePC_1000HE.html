<p>I picked up a <a href = "http://promos.asus.com/US/1000HE/ASUS/index.html">Asus EeePC 1000HE</a> for Claire, and she needs Linux installed on it.  <a href = "http://www.ubuntu.com/products/WhatIsUbuntu/desktopedition">Ubuntu 8.10</a> looked great on the <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Ubuntu_810_on_the_Old_ThinkPad_R40">ThinkPad</a>, so that's what I'm installing on this new netbook.</p>
<p>First problem: get an Ubuntu installer on an 4G SD card.  It turns out that <a href = "http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/"><code>unetbootin</code></a> does an excellent job of this.  I installed it on my <a href = "http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/">Debian unstable</a> server right from the repository.  <code>unetbootin</code> provides a choice of distributions to download and install (including Ubuntu), or you can build a bootable USB device from an existing ISO.</p>
<p>After a few failed attempts, I realized that I needed to repartition the SD card with <code>fdisk</code>, giving the card one big partition, and marking that partition bootable.  That main partition needed to also be given a <code>vfat</code> filesystem (<code>mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdX1</code>), not ext2.</p> 
<p>With the SD card in order, I could have <code>unetbootin</code> install the full Ubuntu 8.10 Live CD image to the main partition (<code>/dev/sdX1</code>).</p>
<p><strong>F2</strong> on the EeePC gets into the setup screen, and there, I disabled all the quick boot stuff and booting off the hard drive.  Then, I rebooted and hit <strong>Esc</strong> to choose a boot device.  Upon choosing the <em>Single Flash Reader</em>, I got to see the SYSLINUX boot screen, and then the nice graphical Ubuntu boot screen.  After a few more moments, it played it's normal chimes and I was looking at the live, wide-screen desktop with battery, bluetooth, wired network indicators going.  I clicked the network applet, and on the Gnome toolbar, and I see that even wireless seems to be working!</p>
<p>The <em>Install</em> icon is sitting right there on the desktop, so I give it a run, tell it to use the whole 160G drive, and it's off. I let that finish, and rebooted, and I'm in business.</p>
<p>At this point, the volume keys aren't working for some reason, but the brightness and suspend keys <em>are</em> working.  First time out, the battery was only lasting 4-5 hours, but I suspect that probably had something to do with the processor scaling defaulting to <code>on-demand</code> instead of <code>conservative</code> or <code>power-save</code>.  I'll have to look into that a bit.</p>
<p>As I search around for solutions to the last few things, I see lots of details on fixing problems I'm not experiencing -- it seems that Ubuntu has taken care of most the hard stuff already, and they've rendered many of the other fix-it articles outdated.</p>
<p>It looks like its going to be a great little machine.</p>
<p><strong>Update (16 March 2009):</strong> I'm still not seeing the 9-hour battery life yet -- instead the fan runs and runs, and I see 4-5 hours.  Additionally, it seems that the ASUS ACPI kernel module is reporting a <a href = "http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?pid=507588#p507588">few events incorrectly</a>, so evolution keeps trying to pop up when I plug in the AC power.  This lead should help me get all the little buttons working, like volume the volume keys.</p>
<p><strong>Update (26 March 2009):</strong> The LCD display, USB hub, keyboard, and mouse arrived for the notebook over the past week.  Ubuntu mostly saw the display correctly when I plugged it in.  I ended up having to restart the X server, and it seems that I have to restart the X server any time I want to switch now, but it took care of the configuration itself.  The external display isn't running at its full resolution yet, though.  I have to look into it a bit closer, but it's working well enough for now.</p>
<p>I assembled the USB gadgetry, left it on the desk.  When Claire found it later, she just plugged it in, and it just worked.  Linux has come a long way.</p>
