<p>I found this link to <a href = "http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=ApacheModProxy"> configuring Apache mod_proxy</a> on java.blogs.  I'd like to get around to doing this sometime soon, so this will probably be a good reference.  It has some directives I've not seen before, like <code>ProxyPreserveHost</code>.</p>
<p>Dealing with Debian's versatile (and complicated) config structure for Apache 2 should be fun as well.   As far as I can gather, I'll have to run PHP in CGI mode, since the module doesn't play well and hasn't been integrated into Debian's Apache 2.  I'm testing on my laptop right now.</p>
