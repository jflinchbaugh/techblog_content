<p>We bought Claire a brand new Nissan Quest, so we need to get rid of her old car.  It's an automatic with working AC, and I'm getting it inspected, so it'll be current until next summer.  We're selling it for $1000.</p>
<p>If you know anyone who would be interested drop me an email or give me a call.</p>
