<p>The day I first played with <a href = "http://www.google.com/glm">Google Local Mobile Java Midlet</a>, I immediately recognized that it was going to be a killer application for my phone.  Previously, I had to use WAP to lookup phone numbers, addresses, and directions.</p>

<p>Here's a little real-life test scenario and the times it took me to accomplish it (including starting the application or browser):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My wife called me for the name and number of the local bike shop.  I knew the name of the place, and I was sitting at my computer, so I typed it into Firefox' Google Search bar really quickly, and found the number from their  Local service.  Then I proceeded to look up this information in other ways on my phone through Google's MIDlet, Google Local via WAP, and YellowPages.com via WAP.</p>

<p>YellowPages.com was the old-style WAP application which requires you to select through a hierarchy of options, which reduces dreaded typing on a mobile device, but greatly increases the number of round-trips over the high-latency EDGE/GPRS network.  This is the sort of thing I'd do in years past on older phones.  I'd say, "Yeah, I can look that up," then struggle embarassingly for a few minutes.  It's much worse when you don't know the name of a place.</p>
<p>Google Local Mobile remembers my location, so it saved me some keystrokes, and the interface is richer, so I don't incur the latencies of paging around the interface.</p>
<p>In addition to getting the phone number in record time, I had the extra information of the map at almost no extra cost in time -- it was filling in the map in the background while I looked at the little balloon of data.</p>
<p>I like having generic WAP interfaces to data, but some things are just much better served by a full application.  I'd like to next see my bank offer a MIDlet interface in addition to their already useful (but sluggish) WAP interface.</p>
