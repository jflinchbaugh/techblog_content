<p>I watched NBC's American version of <a href = "http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/">The Office</a> last night.  It had lots of funny little amusements.  The  direct and sarcastic receptionist character is probably one of the only highlights.</p>
<p>Its "MTV Real World"-style interview thing is sort of annoying -- too much of a carry over from reality television.  It would be funnier if it was just the normal sitcom style.  It seems to be Office Space jokes in reality television style.</p>
