<p><a href = "http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox">Rhythmbox 0.9.4.1</a> recently hit <a href = "http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> Sid, and I think it's addressed all my concerns.</p>
<p>Manipulating the top of the Play Queue no longer loses tracks (and eventually <a href = "http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=364733">crashes</a>).  Additionally, they've added a criteria for building automatic playlists which evaluates the <em>path</em>.  Since I've already organized my audio files by directory, this allows me to much more simply build a playlist based on my previous organization.  Nice!  Now I just wish they'd optionally show me the path in the list, so I can use that to identify files which lack proper tags.</p>
