<p>I've been programming a MIDlet for my phone, and I wanted to make sure I'm following some sort of design standard beyond just cobbling it together from the API docs, so I wandered out to my local Borders Book Store last night.  I found <em>no</em> Java ME (J2ME) books anywhere.  In fact, their computer section has been shrinking for a while.</p>
<p>I find this hard to believe when I've seen a few of these books coming up on publishers' new release lists.  I also take Google's own <a href = "http://www.google.com/glm/">Google Local Mobile</a> MIDlet to be a sign that Java ME really is about to come of age.</p>
<p>Since I was mostly searching for an impulse buy, I'm not going to bother ordering anything online or running out to Ollie's Outlet to buy old bargain-bin books about MIDP 1.0 just yet.  It looks like Sun and others have a pretty good set of <a href = "http://developers.sun.com/techtopics/mobility/midp/reference/techart/index.html">Java ME articles</a> which should get me to the next level nicely.  The <a href = "http://java.sun.com/blueprints/wireless/">wireless blueprint program</a> looks like it may be exactly what I need at this point.</p>
