<p>I've started posting this list around, so I may as well put it here too.  I'm looking to sell a few things I'm not using.  Offers and trades are welcome.</p>
<h2>Nikon EM body ($35)</h2>
<p>includes battery, meter works, auto, M90, and bulb mode, tested working.</p>

<h2>Nikon FE body ($75)</h2>
<p>includes battery, meter works, auto and manual exposure, tested working, very clean.</p>

<h2>Nikon MD-12 winder ($45)</h2>
<p>will test soon, fits FE and others (not EM)</p>

<h2>Spiratone Pluracoat 35-105mm zoom f/3.8 with 1:3 macro, AI lens for Nikon mount. ($40)</h2>
<p>Tested on Nikon D90 and D40 for manual focus and manual exposure, clean.</p>

<h2>Soligor 135mm f/2.5 AI lens for Nikon mount. ($20)</h2>
<p>a fixer-upper. Focuses noticeably short of infinity (to about 30m). I don't care enough to take it apart yet. Very clean and reasonably sharp at f4 in distances it can focus.</p>

<h2>Promaster Spectrum 7 28mm f/2.8 wide angle lens for Nikon mount. ($15)</h2>
<p>works fine, but front thread is dented, so no filters will mount.</p>

<h2>Sigma 70-300mm DG f/4-5.6 with 1:2 macro for Nikon mount. ($80)</h2>
<p>AF/AE on Nikon with AF motor in body. Clean, hood, box. I always used it at 300mm, so I replaced this with a 300mm prime.</p>

<h2>Nikkor 50mm f/2 AI MF lens. ($60)</h2>
<p>MF and ME on my D90. Very clean and smooth. I almost want to keep it, but I already have a couple 50 f/1.8 lenses laying around.</p>
