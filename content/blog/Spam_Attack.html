<p>Wow!  Overnight I got slammed with 30 various spam referrers.  I added a bunch of keywords to my blacklist and deleted them all, but that's all a very manual process, so it took a while.  I really must get coding on this weblog again (it's actually been a couple months), and get a callback-type plugin to have it check referrer links for valid links.</p>
