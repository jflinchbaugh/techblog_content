<p>I was trying to dig up information on how the Prius' planetary gears work between the electric motor, gas engine, and drive (their CVT) just now, and I stumbled upon the <a href = "http://www.wind.sannet.ne.jp/m_matsu/prius/ThsSimu/index_i18n.html?Language=en?Country=US">Prius Driving Simulator</a> which shows you what it's doing in response to driver input.</p>
