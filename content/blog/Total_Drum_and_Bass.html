<p>Such a self-proclaiming name like <i>Total Drum &amp; Bass Mix</i> reminds me way too much of the <i>MTV Jock Jams</i> ("Y'all ready for this?...doo dah dah daaaah duh dah duh..."), but the CD is actually pretty decent -- <a href = "http://www.moonshine.com/">Moonshine Records</a> has always known what it's doing.  The CD has names I've heard, but tracks I have not.  It's also quite clean and devoid of lyrics or rap, unlike Dieselboy's latest, <i>Project Human</i>.  It's not as fast, but it still has a decent pace.</p>
