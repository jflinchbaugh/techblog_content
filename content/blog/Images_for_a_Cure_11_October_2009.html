<div style = "float: right; margin-left: 1ex;"><img src = "http://www.imagesforacure.com/wp-content/themes/kristenweaver/images/ifac-button.jpg"></div><p>This 11 October 2009 is the <a href = "http://www.imagesforacure.com/">Images for a Cure</a> national fundraiser for the <a href = "http://www.bcrfcure.org/">Breast Cancer Research Foundation</a>.  You can participate, by <a href = "mailto:john@hjsoft.com">contacting me</a> or <a href = "http://www.imagesforacure.com/find-a-photographer/">other photographers</a> found on the Images for a Cure site and scheduling a portrait session.</p>
<div style = "clear: both"></div>
<p>For a $40 donation, I'll be offering outdoor portraits of individuals, and for $60, I'll make portraits of small groups. Donations are made online directly to the organization. A session will take 30-60 minutes and for the donated session fee, I'll provide free 4x6 printed proofs or a single free 8x10 print from the session.  More options will be available at an additional price.</p>
<p>All the sessions will be scheduled on Sunday, 11 October, and there are only a limited number of slots available, so drop me an email at <a href = "mailto:john@hjsoft.com">john@hjsoft.com</a> or call me at 717-871-0871 for details.  Thank you, and I hope to see you for the event.</p>
<p>For fellow photographers in the area, I'm looking to recruit an assistant or 2 and another  photographer or 2 to share locations.  Let me know if you might be interested in signing up.  I can also offer a fallback indoor space in case of bad weather.</p>
