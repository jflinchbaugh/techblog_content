<p>Was I not paying attention during the previous two presidential campaigns?  I knew I was voting for the Democratic candidate, but I don't remember thinking I'd be getting super-environmentalists.</p>
<p>Gore ran with the whole <a href = "http://www.climatecrisis.net/">global warming</a> thing, and now it seems the Kerry's have tossed a <a href = "http://www.johnkerry.com/momentonearth/">book onto the bandwagon</a>.</p>
<p>It's great to have high-profile people bringing attention to these issues, but it feels like some may be using these hot issues to <em>maintain</em> their high profile.</p>
<p>I just don't remember these people running on these platforms.  I must wonder if the environment would have been as strong of a component in their leadership if Gore or Kerry had been elected.</p>
