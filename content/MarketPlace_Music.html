<p>If you ever listen to <a href = "http://www.marketplace.org/">MarketPlace</a> on your local public radio station, you know it has a different sound with its eclectic mix of music bits between stories.</p>
<p>It seems they now have the playlist on the PM pages next to the stories, and Jane, the music director, has a little <a href = "http://www.publicradio.org/columns/marketplace/janes_music_blog/">weblog  about her music picks</a>.  Her frequent picks of nice little dance tracks (trip hop, Bjork, etc) always grab me.  I also find the little Ani DiFranco clips fun too.</p>
