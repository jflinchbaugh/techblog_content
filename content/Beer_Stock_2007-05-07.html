<p>The beer fridge was looking pretty barren last weekend (only 2 Yuengling Lagers), but I fixed it.  The nice guy at Kirchner recommended the <a href = "http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/">Harpoon</a> UFO (UnFiltered Offering) Hefeweizen for a good summer wheat beer.  It proved to be an excellent recommendation.  It's light but tasty and grainy feeling.  It goes down like water.</p>
<p>I also picked up a 12-pack of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout.  Fortunately, this doesn't go down like water, because that would be awfully expensive.</p>
<p>Finally, Lynn introduced a 6-pack of Brooklyn Brewery's Double Chocolate Stout to round out the collection.  It's probably been a year since I've had either the Brooklyn or the Sammy Smith.  Good stuff.</p>
