<p>When I started my job over 2 years ago, I recognized that I wanted to work on the framework code, but I ended up doing mostly application code.  I still took my every spare moment to study, recommend, and implement new framework ideas.</p>
<p>Today, a new team organization chart come down from management, and I'm officially on the framework team!  Like I've done in other positions, I've turned my job into what I wanted it to be.</p>

<p>I'm grateful for the freedoms most my jobs have afforded me to advance my knowledge while advancing projects.  At my previous job, I came in as a Java application programmer, started studying J2EE on my own, and introduced it as possible solutions to our current problem-set.  By the time I left there, I was working as the J2EE technical lead architect.</p>
