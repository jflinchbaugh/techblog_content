<p>I finally got around to upgrading the BIOS on my R40, and it couldn't have been more difficult.  IBM only provides a Windows program and a DOS program to create a boot floppy.  I don't have a floppy or Windows on this machine.</p>
<p>A consultant friend at work helped by providing an old ThinkPad drive which actually had Windows installed.  We tried it as primary drive, in the ultrabay, and as a USB drive, but it wouldn't boot properly.  Finally, he did dig up his old ThinkPad floppy drive, and we did the BIOS upgrade with the floppy disk.</p>
<p>If IBM would just provide a CD image I could burn to CD-R, I would have been done much quicker.  Now I have to contemplate spending money on a floppy drive just for the rare occassion of trying to do a BIOS upgrade.  I've survived 9 months or so without one.</p>
