<p>My friend Ben gave me his old <a href = "http://www.sonyericsson.com/t68i/">SonyEricsson T68i</a> (which is one of the phones I've really wanted when it was new).  It supports Bluetooth and <a href = "http://www.attwireless.com/">AT&T Wireless</a> provides my GPRS network, so this gives me something new with which to experiment.</p>
<p>I found a nicely-priced <a href = "http://www.d-link.com/products/?pid=34">D-Link DBT-120</a> USB-BT dongle on eBay, and now I'm set.  I thought it would be convenient just to be able to access the phone's modem functionality while it was still in my pocket, but it gets better than that -- I can put the phone on the other side of the house, where the GPRS signal is stronger and still access it from another room.</p>
<p>I recompiled my Linux 2.6.7 kernel with modules for: <code>bluetooth</code>, <code>l2cap</code>, <code>rfcomm</code>, <code>hci_usb</code>.  I then installed Debian Unstable's latest <code>bluez-utils</code> package.  I think the only bluetooth-specific configurations I needed to change was to add this section to the <code>/etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf</code>:
<pre>rfcomm0 {
    bind yes;
    device 00:0A:D9:13:0B:1B;
    channel 1;
    comment "T68i";
}</pre>
Restarting <code>/etc/init.d/bluez-utils</code> yielded a working <code>/dev/rfcomm0</code> device which allows me to talk to the phone as a modem (just like ircomm0 in case of IRDA).  I ran pppconfig and configured up a pretty standard modem-like PPP session using <code>/dev/rfcomm0</code> as the device, bogus login and passwords, and relatively bogus default chat scripts.  The important part is to dial to the right number: <code>*99#</code>.</p>
<p>My PPP connection kept dropping out after about 2 minutes, due to the lcp-echo requests not being answered.  I had to disable lcp-echo requests with these 2 lines added to the <code>/etc/ppp/peer/provider</code> options file:
<pre>lcp-echo-failure 0
lcp-echo-interval 600</pre>
This disables failure, and additionally tells it to not ping so often (every 5 minutes now).</p>
<p>In my initial tests, I'm seeing about 4.5KiB/s, which isn't terrible for a completely mobile connection.</p>
