<p>I installed my little PixelView BT848 card into my server, so I needed a cable connection to it. I found a random cable splitter, and went to work inserting the splitter into the line before my cablemodem.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is not one of the splitters approved for broadband, because I had been on and off dropping 40% packets just trying to get anywhere past my cablemodem (say, other Comcast subscribers).  When I finally realized this, I tried other cables and such, to find out it was definitely the splitter.</p>
<p>I'll have to go find a better splitter before I can get into exploring MythTV or some other DVR package.  I did have xawtv working, though.  Hopefully the better splitter will get me a better signal there too.</p>
