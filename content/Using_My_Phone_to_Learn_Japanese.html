<p>I'm now using my S710a to study Japanese.  I have a 128M memory stick in it, so I can easily carry around a handful of 10-minute podcasts from <a href = "http://www.japanesepod101.com/">JapanesePod101</a>.  I'm listening to the Beginner and Survival lessons.  The production is very good and the material is presented very well, so it's a pleasure to listen.</p>
<p>Having it in my phone, I can easily play a lesson on the speaker phone a couple times a day while I'm driving.  I intend to take my time, so I try to do a lesson each couple days, and I step back to previous ones that are still on my phone for a review.</p>
<p>There's already nearly a year of material posted, so it's going to take me a long time to catch up, if I ever do.</p>
