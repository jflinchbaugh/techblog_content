<p>I've been absent from work more in the past week than I've been at work.  I started getting fevery before Todd's wedding, then I lost my voice after the wedding, developed that into a head cold then pink eye.</p>
<p>I took Friday off to make sure I was available for wedding things, then I missed work on Monday and Thursday due to illness.  I hope the weekend starts off better.</p>
