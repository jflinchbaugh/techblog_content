<p>I've finally gotten all the code in place to facilitate adding my weblog to <a href = 
"http://www.javablogs.com/ViewBlog.action?id=12262">java.blogs</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href = "http://www.churchillobjects.com/c/13005.html">rss4j</a> library seems to be a bit funny at times, so I had to modify it a bit to get it to stop inserting an empty <code>xmlns</code> attribute on each element, doubling up the <code>xmlns:rdf</code> attribute in the root, or sticking <code>Z</code> into the date format instead of the proper <code>+00:00</code> for the timezone.  I expect it may be a bad interaction between j2sdk1.4's xml support and the library, which is showing its age a bit and may have been relying upon behaviors of an older xerces.</p>
<p>Can anyone recommend a better RSS lib for java?  I guess I should go take a look at what roller uses, or just do my own.</p>
<p><strong>Update (13 July 2004):</strong> A recent upgrade to JBoss 3.2.4 apparently brought a newer xml api implementation, and stock rss4j started behaving much more appropriately.  Of course, it was broken for a week or so until I noticed that the behavior had changed.  I'm still maintaining the +00:00 change, though.</p>
