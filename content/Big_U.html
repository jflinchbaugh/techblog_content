<p>I finally finished reading Neal Stephenson's <i>Big U</i>.  It took me a really long time, because I read slowly, and I don't really take the time to read often.</p>
<p>Way back when, I read a book about speed reading. (That probably took me a while to read too.)  If I concentrate and think about it, I can actually do it, but I never remember to practice it.  I repeatedly slip into my old slow reading habits (mentally vocalizing, re-reading, etc).</p>
<p>I may take a bit of a reading hiatus just to code, but I'll be looking for another book.  I have <i>Cryptonomicon</i> in my personal library, but it's really intimidating for someone who reads as slowly as I do.  Gibson's <i>Pattern Recognition</i> is out there somewhere, so I may just catch up on my Gibson.  Anyone have any other recommendations?</p>
