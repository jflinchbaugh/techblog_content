For the second year
I'm taking part
in the https://adventofcode.com/2019[Advent of Code]
with friends and http://www.sonatype.com/[coworkers].
I'm using https://clojure.org/[Clojure] again this year.

The Advent of Code
is a story and series
of puzzles
released as 2 parts daily.
There's a https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/[community]
of people https://adventofcode.com/2019/leaderboard[competing]
at various levels
to complete the puzzles
faster than others.
I was keeping up fine
for the first 7 days or so,
but I eventually fell behind
like many people.
Fortunately,
everyone can continue to work
at our own pace.
The puzzles
from previous years
continue to be available.

I'm happy
to find
that I'm having an easier time
with Clojure this year,
and I'm more easily
able to use it to _describe_
the algorithms
instead of struggling
with the language.
I publish https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/aoc2019[my code]
to Github.
