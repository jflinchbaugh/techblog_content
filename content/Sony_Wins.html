<p>Nearly a month ago, my Sony DRU-710A DVD burner started throwing media errors for any DVD I put into it, so the drive is obviously having issues.  It had been fine for over 6 months previously.  I hadn't changed anything in its host computer, but I still went and tried it in the big computer to see the same behavior.</p>
<p>Sony tech support wouldn't entertain my complaints until I found a friend with a Windows 2000/XP computer and demonstrated the error there.  They suggested trying <em>approved</em> media, which didn't work, but I was just hoping to make it work -- I thought maybe it had just started to slip out of tight spec, so better media might actually make a difference.</p>
<p>It took 3 weeks and 3 times in friends' computers conducting one small test after another to finally get them to admit that the drive may be broken.  I'm not sure what I expected not having a Windows box to test, but it just felt terribly obstructed at every turn. I guess it's the cost of not paying the Microsoft tax (in license fee and disk space) on a computer I actually want to use.</p>
<p>Further more, they now want me to fax a copy of the receipt, which I don't have anymore, since I deleted the scan I had when the rebate check came in the mail.  Even If I could find the receipt, when they see that the poorly-placed warranty seal sticker was ripped by my computer case during installation, they'll try to charge me for repair.  <em>I quit!</em>  It's not worth my time anymore!</p>
<p>I would have titled this article <strong>Sony Loses</strong>, as in a customer, but really, I don't buy much of anything to matter.  I can't imagine they care.  It's apparently not really all that important to impress me -- It's more econimical to defend againsnt and deflect the user.</p>
<p>Historically, I've kept a pretty compartmentalized view of Sony.  As a long-time fan of Ericsson and Sony Ericsson phones, I've ignored the antics of their media division (rootkits and DRM), and I didn't think I had reason to avoid their computer hardware.  Taking into account the difficulty of their storage tech support, the antics of their media division, and my <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/S710a__Unsigned_Java_Midlets__Frustration">dissatisfaction with trying to develop for my mobile phone</a>, I may just need to stop buying Sony products completely.  I hate not being able to use my devices as I want, whether it's with my OS of choice or deciding what code to trust on my phone.</p>
<p>Now I'll probably just rip the drive apart (since the warranty sticker's already broken) and see  if I can clean it and make it work. If not, I'll just go buy a new NEC for $50 found on Pricewatch.</p>
