<p>I was hoping that my <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/ThinkPad_BIOS_Upgrade">labored BIOS upgrade</a> would yield a completely stable machine.  It locked on me again today, though.  As usual, it ran for 3-4 days, then froze about 5 minutes after resuming from swsusp.</p>
<p>I happened to be at my logging console this time, instead of in X.  I got one lone odd asterisk thrown in an odd place on the screen -- usually, I'd see some slight corruptions on the X screen.  The cursor still blinked, but none of the SysRq key combos did anything.</p>
