<p>I'm accustomed to being the person calling to ripping out the JVM or the application server and replacing it with the latest and greatest versions, but I tried to be a little more conservative and less crazy at my current work place.</p>
<p>Now, I hear all the talk of ripping out JVMs and app servers, but I'm not the one instigating it, and I'm not really included in the process.  They all seem to be good ideas, but it makes me feel uneasy to not be at the forefront.  I'm just a programmer who will live with these changes.  I don't want to be just a programmer, I want to be an architect too.  Hmm.  Oh well, maybe next time.</p>
