<p>I've <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/A_New_Phone_Lust_T616">wanted a T616</a> for a while, and I finally went out and got one.  The reception is much better in my house than my T68i or Siemens S46, since it has the newer bands that AT&amp;T has been deploying.</p>
<p>Now I'll have to find time to learn J2ME, but in the meantime <a href = "http://myt610.lasyk.net/">MyT610</a> will keep me busy customizing my phone.</p>
