I bought a very small laptop
to use with radio work in the field,
and the screen resolution is a bit small (1366x768).
Pair the small display
with current desktop environments'
tendency toward chunky, touch-friendly interfaces,
and it doesn't allow one to cram much on the screen.

My desktop environment is Gnome,
so I slimmed it down with some stylesheets:
----
headerbar {
  margin: 0 1em 0 1em;
  padding: 0;
  border-width: 0px;
  font-size: 12pt;
  min-height: 0px;
}
headerbar * {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border-radius: 0;
  border-width: 0px;
  min-height: 0px;
}

headerbar box {
  padding: 0.1em 0.5em 0.1em 0.5em;
}
----


WSJT-X is a QT app,
so I scaled the fonts
there to make everything fit better by setting the DPI
in a launch script:
----
#!/bin/sh

export QT_FONT_DPI=75
/usr/bin/wsjtx
----
