I created a little
https://github.com/jflinchbaugh/reloaderjs[ReloaderJS]
script that I use with a couple projects.
Upon applying the script,
the page is always reloaded
and up-to-date
any time I switch to the tab
or wake the laptop.

The script allows reloading
at a period that matches
the schedule
at which the underlying site
is updated.
It also doesn't bother updating when the site
is unavailable (down or the client is offline).

It really stands out now
when I see a site that's tried to reload
but couldn't, so it's showing an error page
from the browser
when I open my laptop.
