<p>I've deployed the weblog code for the first time in 5 months.  It looks the same, but a lot has changed behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homegrown Struts ChainAction to use <a href = "http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/chain/">commons chain 1.0</a> to implement everything in Chain of Responsibility pattern.</li>
<li>Lots of code cleanup (imports, etc) via Eclipse.</li>
<li>Shrunken referrer list (shift-reload for that new stylesheet).</li>
<li>Actually spell "Referrer" the English way, instead of the W3C way ("Referer:" in HTTP headers).</li>
<li>Incoming trackbacks now get truncated to avoid overtaking the "Last Comment" panel.</li>
<li>Upgrade to Struts 1.2.7.</li>
<li>XHTML 1.0 Strict.</li>
<li>Comments are required to be XHTML 1.0 Strict to be saved.</li>
<li>Upgrade to use xDoclet 1.2.3, which took some changes to my <code>findAll</code> finders.</li>
<li>Now deploy web tier with <code>jboss-client.jar</code> to alleviate JBoss 4.0.2 classloader issues.</li>
</ul>
