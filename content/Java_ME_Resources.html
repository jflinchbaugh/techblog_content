<p>An old friend submitted a <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/SonyEricsson_S710a">comment</a> inquiring about how to get started in Java ME, so here's my list of pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tool up: <a href = "http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, <a href = "http://eclipseme.org/">EclipseME</a>, and Sun's <a href = "http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/">Wireless Toolkit</a> (I still use WTK 2.2).</li>
<li><a href = "http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=426">Beginning J2ME: From Novice to Professional</a> is a <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/Book_Beginning_J2ME">very thorough book</a>, and I recommend it.</li>
<li>When I need to start making my apps look better, I'll probably look at <a href = "http://www.j2mepolish.org/">J2ME Polish</a>.</li>
<li>I watch <a href = "http://www.getjar.com/">GetJar</a> to keep up with the other apps and games.</li>
<li>I heard discussed in some podcast that the <a href = "http://developer.sprint.com/">Sprint Developer Program</a> is pretty open with access to lots of the Java APIs (sometimes using developer root certificates).</li>
<li>Cingular's and SonyEricsson's security models for their phones can be <a href = "http://www.hjsoft.com/blog/link/S710a__Unsigned_Java_Midlets__Frustration">infuriating</a>, so you definitely want to search around and maybe even personally test what an application can do on a phone you're thinking of purchasing.</li>
<li>I still intend to stick with Cingular, though, so I'll say that the phones that currently interest me are the <a href = "http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=893">SonyEricsson W810</a> or maybe the <a href = "http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=890">Samsung D807</a>.</li>
<li>I collect other links on delicious tagged: <a href = "http://del.icio.us/jflinchbaugh/JavaME">JavaME</a> and <a href = "http://del.icio.us/jflinchbaugh/Java+Mobile">Java+Mobile</a>.</li>
<li>Lastly, you'll find anything else I have to say on this subject under the Java or Mobile categories on this weblog.</li>
</ul>
